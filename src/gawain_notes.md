PART I

It was Christmas at Camelot, and everyone was there.

The most chivalrous knights in all the land, the rock stars of their day, and the racing drivers, the most beautiful women, the supermodels of the time, and of courrse, the royalty: all of them, hard living, fast riding, and larger than life. And with reputations to match. And chief amongst them, King Arthur, the king of highest renown.

Outside, there was jousting, and competition; inside, there was dancing; feasting and dancing; feasting, and dancing, and dancing, and feasting; and carousing. There was lots of carousing; because you can't have feasting and dancing without carousing. In fact, there was so much feasting and dancing and carousing, with double portions all round, at every course, that before anyone knew it, Christmas had almost turned into New Year. Because for now, it was New Year's Eve.

As was the custom at the end of the year, there were also presents. But presents aren't part of this story. At least, not yet.

__Everyone was seated, according to custom, in order of rank;__ Guinevere was on the platform, and alongside her, King Arthur. The finest tapestries hung on the wall behind them. And beside them, sat Gawain, Arthur's nephew.

__The food was served, as custom decrees, to each man as his station deserved.__ But for now, the King waited waited. Because it was his custom, on that New Year's eve, not to eat until a story had been told, of some chivalrous deed,  or derring do, from amongst the knights; or for a challenge to be made against one of them.

And he waited.

It had been a slow year...

And he waited some more...

"A story from the minstrels, then, to entertain us whilst we wait", and a minstrel was a summoned. "Give us a tale of my father's time, of Uther Pendragon and his band of knights. A Christmas tale, if you will..."

So not wanting to offend any of Arthur's knights on that festive night, with tales of greater derring do from Uther's court than anything Arthur's men had achieved that year, the minstrel began...

[*Sir Cleges and the Winter Cherries.* There was once a knight...] And there the minstrel's tale ended...

And with that, the bugles blared again, and more food was brought in, so fast that the tables barely had time to be cleared from one course to the next.

But while everyone there was fed as well as any man or woman could be fed, and then some more, still King Arthur waited, for a tale of great honour, or derring do, from his own Court, or for a challenge to be made against one of his men.

And he waited...

And then, suddenly, because there'd be no story if nothing else happened, there was a mighty sound from outside; and a fearful form appeared at the door; a giant of a man; a giant of a man, standing barefoot, in the stirrups of a mighty great war horse.

But not just any horse....for the horse's tack, from its harness to its girth, from its saddle to its stirrups, they were all coloured green. As was its hair: from its combed and knotted mane, to its ribbon braided tail.

But even though the huge great knight was straddling a war horse, he wasn't wearing any armour; nor was he carrying a shield; nor even a sword. Instead, he was wearing just a simple dark green cloak, and a simple dark green tunic. A dark green hood, and dark green leggings.

But that wasn't the strangest of it, not at all: for the stranger himself, from his long flowing hair, to his great bushy beard, he was completely green too.

And he laughed at the court. "Ha, haaaaa."

In place of a shield, he carried a sprig of holly; instead of a sword, an axe. A great big axe. A *huge* great big axe: the mother of all axes. And not just any mother of all axes. Because this axe was made of glowing green steel; and inlaid in the handle, the most intricate, the most exquisite, green jeweled and green enameled decoration.

Looking around the Court, this great, Green Knight was the first to speak: "So, who's the boss of this horrible lot, then? Who's the leader of this rabble?"

And everyone just gawped, dumbstruck; and a deep, expectant hush fell on the hall, as they waited for Arthur to respond.

"A warm welcome to you, sir, on this cold winter's night. I am Arthur, the head of this household. You are welcome to join us."

"Thank you," said the knight, "but no. That is *not* why I am here."

And there was silence. As everyone else looked at the axe.

"Do not be afraid". said the knight. "You can see I am not dressed for war."

And he gestured his tunic with the hand that held the holly.

Whilst everyone else watched the axe.

"I was wondering if any of you would be up, for a game? A Christmas game. For a simple challenge...?"

<hr/>

*As to what sort of challenge he had in mind, you'll just have to wait to find out, until the story comes around again.*

*You may recall, it's King Arthur's court at Camelot. A huge Green Knight has appeared, armed with an axe and a sprig of holly. He has offered a challenge, but what sort of challenge?*

The assembled Court listened expectantly.

"A blow for a blow, with the axe, and I'll bare my neck first... and whosoever takes the strike: I'll meet them in a year and a day from now, and take my turn."

*And just in case anyone is tempted to play this game at Christmas, I'd probably recommend against it...*

No-one replied. Coughs went around the room, and the knights of Arthur's Court looked at the floor, and avoided the Green Knight's gaze.

And the Green Knight laughed: "So the house of King Arthur, the knights of the famous Round Table, are all a bunch of wimps?"

And as he laughed at them for their cowardice, King Arthur himself stood up, enraged, and perhaps not a little embarrassed.

"No-one in this Court is afraid of that challenge", he said, "except, perhaps, for being associated with such foolishness. So give me the axe, and I'll take the blow, and let that be that, and let us all be done with it."

But before he could take the axe, Gawain, his nephew, came leaping up.

"No sire, __let *me* do it__. It is not fitting for you, the King, to take on such a trifling challenge. Nor even for any of your other knights. So __let me do it__, the least of your men, let me take the blow."

And Gawain knelt before Arthur to receive his blessing, and the King gave him a few words of advice.

"Strike bold, and true, and you will have nothing to fear in return."

*That sounds a bit like the advice given at the start of the blind challenge on Bake Off, doesn't it...?*

__"Be bold, with the thyme, and make sure you cook it through."__ Whatever...

But before Gawain could take up the challenge, the Green Knight bid him to state his name, and to repeat the challenge, and to seal the covenant between them.

"I am Gawain," was the response. "I'll wield this axe now, and in a year and a day, you may strike me in return."

"Spot on", said the Green Knight. "Now, swear that you, and only you, will seek me out to return the blow."

And Gawain agreed. "But where will I find you?"

"I'll tell you when you've taken the blow', said the Green Knight. And with that, he handed over the axe, stood before Sir Gawain, heaped his long green hair onto the top of his head, and bared his neck.

Gawain took the axe, planted his feet, and swung a mighty blow, severing the spinal cord, and cleaving the Green Knight's head clean from his neck, so cleanly that the axe hit the stone floor in a shower of sparks.

The head tumbled to the floor, and the other knights kicked at it as it rolled by.

But even as the red blood spurted from the Green Knight's neck and onto the floor, his body staggered forward, the arms flailing in search of the head.

*If you've ever seen the University Challenge episode of the Young Ones, when Vivien loses his head as he looks out of a train window, you can probably imagine it in the same way that I can...*

Eventually the Green Knight's flailing arms found their target, and the knight stood up straight, holding his head beside him. He walked towards his horse, and remounted it. And as he wheeled the horse about, the blood continued to drain from the severed head and onto the floor.

As he was about to depart, he twisted the head round to face the platform. It opened its eyes and stared straight ahead.

"Be sure to keep your word, Gawain. You will find me at the site of the Green Chapel. I am known as the Green Knight". And with that, he turned again, and was gone.

King Arthur turned to Guinevere, who was in a certain amount of shock.

"Well that was a bit a odd... But never fear, at least I can have something to eat now!"

And then he turned to Gawain, told him to hang up the mighty axe on the wall behind them, and bade everyone to eat.

And so it was that more food was brought, and the singing and the dancing resumed until late in the night, and probably some carousing too, and the New Year dawned.

PART II

If there had been silence before, now everyone was talking about Sir Gawain's chances a year a day from then, and that is how the old year passed and the new one began.

And so the season's progressed: the lean times of Lent came and went, and Spring waged war on Winter. Summer came around, and Autumn, and as the year passed   Michaelmas and gave way to Winter again, Gawain was reminded of his covenant and began to rouse himself, ready to set out, and find the Green Knight.

But even then he tarried, till Hallowe'en, and All Saints' Day. And again the Court feasted, as Sir Gawain made ready to take his leave of the King.

And as he left the Court, there were sounds of sadness and sorrow about the strike that Sir Gawain should take without reply.

But he remained there still, all through that All Saints' Day, but early the next morning, he called for his arms.

First, an extravagant silk tunic, then a thick warm cloak, lined with white fur. Stout steel shoes, and shiny plate to cover his knees, tied behind with golden thread. Sturdy leg guards, and the finest chain mail, tiny hoops of shimmering steel. Then elbow guards, and metal gloves to complete the attire, with a sword fastened to a belt, by his side.

And in his armour he took a final Mass, then mounted Gringolet, his faithful, gold dressed war horse, picked up his helmet, and made ready to leave.

He was passed his scarlet shield, Ferrari red, emblazoned with a golden pentangle livery, which he slung on his back.

The pentangle was a continuous five pointed star, an eternal knot, representation of his five flawless senses, his fingers that never fumbled, his faith, founded on the five wounds Christ received on the Cross, the five joys that gave him strength, of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the birth of her son, and the five principles by which he lived: friendship, fraterniry, purity, politeness and pity.

As Gawain spurred his horse Gringolet away, with pity in their hearts and tears in their eyes.

And so he rode, and he rode, and he rode through England's realm, foraging for his food and with no friend other than his horse.

Through North Wales, to the Wirral, and everywhere he goes he asks the same question: do the people there know of a Green Chapel, or Green Knight. And always the answer is: "no; we have never heard of such a place, never heard of such a knight".

He scales steep slopes, bridges brooks, scraps with serpents and snarling wolves, with bears, and bulls and the occasional wild boar. But worst of all was the coming of the winter weather, the crystallised rain and the frosted, frozen ground.

And so he prays to God. And to Mary. And to Jesus Christ the Lord. And he makes the sign of the cross: once, twice, three times...

And as he does so, making his way through the frosted wood, he sees the most impressive castle ahead, with its drawbridge withdrawn, and sturdy gates, shuttered fast.

He halted Gringolet, and called out to the porter, and to the watchman on the wall. And he was greeted in return.

"Could you take a message to the master of this place?" called out Gawain, "would he grant me shelter?"

And the porter replied: "it would be my pleasure."

And before Gawain knew it, the drawbridge was lowered, the gate opened, and Gawain rode across.

He was helped free of his shield and his sword and his helmet, and taken inside, where he was greeted warmly by the Lord:

"You are most welcome, so come in, come in, and make yourself at home."

And Gawain thanked him.

The master of the castle had hard, fiery face, and bushy red beard.

Gawain was shown to his room, finely furnished with the riches tapestries, and curtains.

He removed his armour, now rusted and weather beaten, and was presented in its place with a fine set of robes.

He returned to the hall, and was seated by a roaring red fire, to help him thaw out from the cold.

A table was set and a feast laid before him. the finest fish dishes that Gawain had ever seen, let alone eaten.

Then question followed question and Gawain answered politely, admitting his name, and that he was one of Arthur's Round Table.

And everyone there was suitably impressed, for never had they had such a celebrity in their midst, a knight of legend and lore.

Day became dusk, and the meal came to an end. The bells sounded evensong, and everyone assembled there made their way to make their prayers.

And with them, went Gawain.

Accompanying the Lord, was his Lady, who seemed fairer to Gawain than even the Queen, Guinevere.

As they left the Church, she was hand in hand with another woman, much older, withered and well advanced in years, her cheeks waddled and slack compared to the bloom of her younger, and fairer, companion. There was just no comparison. ANd Gawain and the fair Lady exchanged courtesies.

Gawain glanced at the younger woman, and by the grace of the Lord, approached them both, the fair and the foul. At which point, they took him between them, arm in arm, and led him away, talking as they walked.

And again, they sat by the fire, and feasted on cake and the finest wine, until it was time for bed.

The next day dawned, and again there were banquets and buffets.

__Everyone was seated, according to custom, in order of rank.__ The ancient old crone was sat at the high table next to the Lord, and Gawain sat next to the younger. And __the food was served, as custom decrees, to each man as his station deserved__. And throughout the meal, Gawain and the fair Lady, chattered and conversed and whispered sweetly to each other.

The next day, they drank, and danced, and the next, and the next day after that too. St John's Day passed and the Christmas feasting was coming to a close. In the greyness of the following day, the guests were take their leave, and so Gawain began to make his goodbyes; but though it was late, he was ushered into the host's own chamber, and thanked for visiting and so honouring his house.

And then the Lord of that place asked Sir Gawain if he might impose on him, and ask what mission it was that should keep him away from Camelot at Christmas time, and Gawain explained to him his quest to find the Green Chapel and the Green Knight, but he knew not where to begin. And time was running out. And he told of the covenant with the Green Knight, the blow for a blow that was to be exchanged on New Year's Day, just three more days away.

And the Lord laughed, and smiled. "Don't worry yourself", he said, "I know the place, it is but a short ride away. So stay until New Year's Day, and I'll have you led there at first light.

And at this news, Gawain was overjoyed, and swore himself to the service of the Lord until that time' and the Lord called for the ladies to join them, and they continued to share good cheer and conversation late into the night.

And the Lord praised Gawain for joining in their festivities night after night, even though he must have been tired from his journey, and told him to have a lie in the following morning, whilst he, the Lord, went out hunting. And his wife, the young Lady, would keep him company all day.

But the Lord also bade Gawain to join him in a pact, in a wager. "Whatever I take in the hunt tomorrow, shall be yours. But in return, I want from you whatever you shall gain during the day." An odd request, but Gawain agreed - he had bid himself to the service of the Lord, after all. And so they sealed the pact with a toast, and when it came time to go to bed they repeated the pact again. But who knew what game was afoot...

PART III

Before sunrise, the servants stirred and made ready the horses for those who would hunt. After __mass, and a quick early breakfast__, the hunters cantered off on their chosen course, the Lord amongst them. And as they rode out, the bugles blared. And the hunt was on.

The wild creature of the forest quaked with fear, not least among them, the deer. For though the male of that kind was not to be hunted in the close season, the hinds were fair game. And the arrows flew, and the hunting was good indeed, and many a kill was had that day. (These were different times!)

__*Meanwhile*, back at the castle,__ Gawain lay snug and warm in his bed, surrounded by curtains and under a mountain of covers.

When suddenly, he hears a sound, like the door to his room being quietly opened. He peeks through the curtains and sees the Lady, the beautiful one, creep in, and close the door.

Obviously, he does what __any virtuous knight would do__, and pretends to be asleep. Silently, the Lady creeps towards the bed, opens the curtains, ans sits herself on the edge.

Gawain continues to pretend to be asleep, hoping she'll go away.

But she doesn't She just sits there, gently stroking the bed clothes. And waits.

After a while, Gawain realises she isn't about to go anywhere in a hurry, and so he does what __any virtuous knight would do,__ and pretends to wake up, starts to stretch, and then feigns being startled to see her there.

And smiling sweetly at him, she beings to speak:

"Good morning, Sire. How deeply you seem to sleep... But now I have you trapped!" and with that, she pins him down beneath the bed clothes.

"Erm, good morning, my Lady" he stammers, as any virtuous knight would do. "I... how might I help you? If you just let me get up and get dressed, I'll gladly be at your service."

But still she pinned him down. "That won't be necessary, *Sir* Gawain, who is feared through the land, yet seems to be trapped by a mere lady" and she giggled again. "And with my husband out all day.... And the servants all asleep... And my maids probably with them. The door is bolted, so I'll take my time, and I expect you will do what you will..."

Now, as __any virtuous knight would do__, Sir Gawain stifled back an embarrassed cough, and struggling for something else to say, thanked the Lady for praising him so, but said he was not so worthy.

"Oh, but if you are Gawain, you surely are..." and she sang his praises again.

"I thank you again", said Sir Gawain, "but I hardly merit such respect. Whereas you, erm, you are truly... joyful, and..generous..." and he flattered her as some form of self-defence.

And so it was, pinned down as he was, he deflected each of her advances, and avoided each of her approaches, until at last she said she would leave him in peace...

And then laughed and bade her farewell. "I was right..." she said, "you could never be Sir Gawain..."

And to that he took affront. "But why-ever not, my Lady?"

"I have heard the stories", she said, "of you knights of the Round Table. How the real Sir Gawain never even crave a kiss after such a lovely time together.."

"But my Lady", he said, "I never meant to offend...", but before he could finish, she had returned to the bedside and given him a single goodbye kiss.

And promptly left.

Gawain immediately jumped out of bed, pulled on some clothes — whether he had a cold shower first I surely don't know — and headed off to Mass, and then a leisurely breakfast, where he was seated between the Lady, and the old crone, and all was good between them.

And all was going well back on the hunt, too, with the Lord still leading the chase against the hinds. And finally, with the dogs run out and the horses tired from the chase, they survey their kill. They pick the finest deer, they butcher it there and then, feeding the scraps and the offal to the dogs as they do so. And with that, the kill horn is blown, the hunt is ended, and they haul the meat home.

The whole of the household was summoned into the hall, and the venison revealed to the assembled crowd. and in particular, to Sir Gawain, who said he had never seen anything like it before, let alone out of season.

"And it's all yours", said the Lord, "as per our agreement. What I won on the hunt, I give to you."

"And I shall give to what I received here, in turn," said Gawain, and he walked up to the Lord, and gave him a kiss.

"A fancy thing", said the Lord. "But how did you come by it?"

And Gawain just smiled. "That was *not* part of our bargain", replied.

And so they lounged by the fire, and feasted, and agreed to the same game again, on the morrow, each of their takings to be traded at day's end.

And the drinking continued, and eventually they went to bed.

But even though they had been up late, by the third cock's crow, the Lord was up for __mass, and a quick, early breakfast__, and out on the hunt. Before long, the hounds had picked up on the scent of a mighty wild boar, bigger than the biggest of big things, even as wild boars go, and whenever the men got near, it fought back in return, and mauled many of the men with its gleaming white tusks. And even their arrows bounced off its thick, tough hide.

The boar is cornered again, and again breaks free, and heads in to the forest, pursued by the Lord alone.

__Meanwhile*, back at the castle,__ a door quietly opens, and the Lady creeps in. parts the curtains round the bed, and peeps in. She giggles girlishily, as Gawain greets her, and she gently teases him again.

"Did you not learn your lesson yesterday, Sir Knight? To claim a kiss quickly, when one is required?"

And carefully Gawain replied, "Dear Lady, I dare not, lest a kiss be declined."

"But someone as strong and powerful as you could easily force a kiss on one such as I..."

"And what would that make me? Such behaviour goes against my grain. But as you request, I cannot deny", and with that, the fair lady gave him the sweetest morning kiss.
