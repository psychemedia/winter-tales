PART I

It was Christmas in Camelot, and all the Round Table were there.

The most chivalrous knights in all the land, the most wonderful women, the handsomest King, of highest renown.

Outside, there was jousting, and competition; inside, there was dancing, dancing and feasting; dancing, and feasting, and feasting, and dancing; and carousing, lots of carousing; and more feasting and dancing, as much feasting and dancing as befits Christmas time, as befits New Year. Double portions all round, at every course. And as was the custom at the end of the year: presents.

They were also seated according to custom, in order of rank, Guinevere on the platform, alongside Arthur, with the finest tapestries hung on the wall behind. And beside them, too, Gawain, Arthur's nephew.

And they waited. For it was also Arthur's custom, on that New Year's eve, that he would not eat until a story was told of some chivalrous deed, or a challenge was made to one of the knights. And they waited. It had been a slow year...

"A story from the minstrels, then, while we wait" called the King, and a minstrel was a summoned. "Give us a tale of my father's time, of Uther Pendragon and his band of knights. A Christmas tale, if you will..."

And so, not wanting to offend any of Arthur's knights, there assembled, with tales of greater derring do from Uther's court than anything Arthur's knights had achieved throughout that year just finished, the minstrel began...

[*Sir Cleges and the Winter Cherries.* There was once a knight...] And there the minstrel's tale ended...

And with that, the bugles blared again, and more food was brought in, so fast that the tables barely had time to be cleared from one course to the next.. But while everyone there was fed as well as a man or woman could be fed, and then some more, still King Arthur waited, for a tale of great honour, or derring do, or for a challenge to be made to one of the Court..

When suddenly, a sound, from outside, and a fearful form appeared at the door, a giant of a man, stood barefoot in the stirrups a mighty great horse.

But not just any horse....for the horse's tack, from the harness to the girth, the saddle to the stirrups, was all coloured green. And so was its hair, from its combed and knotted main, to its ribbon braided tail.

But even though he rode a war horse, he had no armour on, not even a shield, nor even a sword. Just a dark green cloak, and a dark green tunic. A dark green hood, and dark green leggings.

But that was not the strangest of it: for the stranger himself, for his long flowing hair, and for his great bushy beard, they were also coloured the richest of greens too... And rather than a shield, he carried a sprig of holly, and rather than a sword, an axe. A *huge* axe, the mother of all axes, made of green steel and with decoration inlaid in the handle.

Looking around, he was the first to speak: "So who's the boss of this horrible lot, then?"

<hr/>

*And as to what happened next, you'll just have to wait until the story comes around again.*

And everyone just gawped, dumbstruck, and a deep, expectant hush fell on the hall, as they waited for Arthur to respond.

"A warm welcome to you, sir, on this winter's night. I am Arther, the head of this household. You are welcome to join us."

"Thank you, but no", said the knight. "You can see I am not kitted out for war, but I do wonder: are you up for a game, for a challenge...?"

and Arthur assumed he meant a fight.

But that wasn't at all what the knight had in mind. Instead, he favoured a Christmas game:

"A blow for a blow. With the axe. And I'll bare my neck first... and whosever takes the strike? I'll meet them in a year and a day from now, and take my turn."

No-one replied. Coughs went round the room, and the knights of Arthur's Court looked at the floor, and avoided the Green Knight's gaze.

And the Green Knight laughed: "So the house of Arthur, the knights of the famed Round Table, are all wimps?"

And as he laughed at them for their cowardice, Arthur himself stood up, enraged, embarrassed perhaps.

"No-one in this Court is afraid of that challenge, except for being associated with such foolishness. So give me that axe, and let's be done with it."

But before he could take the axe, Gawain, his nephew, leaped forward instaead.

"No sire, let *me* do it.

"It is not fitting for you, the King, to take on such a trifling challenge, and I know your other knights feel the same. So let me, the least of your knights, do the deed."

And as Gawain knelt before Arthur to receive his blessing, the King gave him a few words of advice.

"Strike bold, and true, and you will have nothing to fear in return."

But before Gawain could take up the challenge, the Green Knight bid him to state his name, and repeat the challenge, to seal the covenant between them.

"I am Gawain," was the response. "I'll wield this axe now, and in a year and a day you may strike me in return."

"Spot on", said the Green Knight. "Now swear that you, and only you, will seek me out to return the blow."

And Gawain acquiesced. "But where will I find you?"

"I'll tell you when you've taken the blow', said the Green Knight, and with that, he handed over the axe and stood before Sir Gawain, heaped his hair on the top of his head, and bared his neck.

Gawain took the axe, planted his feet, and swung a mighty blow, severing the spinal cord and cleaving the Green Knight's head from his neck so cleanly the axe hit the stone floor in a shower of sparks.

The head tumbled to the floor, and the other knights kicked at it as it rolled by.

But even as the red blood spurted from the Green Knight's neck and onto the floor, his body staggered forward, the arms flailing in search of the head.

Eventually they found their target, and the knight stood up straight, holding the head beside him, walked towards his horse, and remounted it. And as he wheeled the horse about, the blood continued to drain from the severed head on to floor.

As he was about to depart, he wheeled the head around to face the platform. It opened its eyes and stared straight ahead.

"Be sure to keep your word, Gawain. You will find me at the site of the Green Chapel. I am known as the Green Knight". And with that, he turned again, and was gone.

King Arthur turned to Guinevere, who was in not a little state of shock.

"Well that was a bit a odd... But never fear, at least I can have something to eat now!"

And then he turned to Gawain, told him to hang up the mighty axe on the wwall behind them, and bade everyone to eat.

And so it was that more food was brought, and the singing and the dancing resumed until late in the night, and the New Year dawned.

PART II

If there had been silence before, now everyone was talking about Sir Gawain's chances a year a day from then, and that is how the old year passed and the new one began.

And so the season's progrssed: the lean times of Lent came and went, and Spring waged war on Winter. Summer came around, and Autumn, and as the year passed   Michaelmas and gave way to Winter again, Gawain was reminded of his covenant and began to rouse himself, ready to set out, and find the Green Knight.

But even then he tarried, till Hallowe'en, and All Saints' Day. And again the Court feasted, as Sir Gawain made ready to take his leave of the King.

And as he left the Court, there were sounds of sadness and sorrow about the strike that Sir Gawain should take without reply.

But he remained there still, all through that All Saints' Day, but early the next morning, he called for his arms.

First, an extravagant silk tunic, then a thick warm cloak, lined with white fur. Stout steel shoes, and shiny plate to cover his knees, tied behind woith golden thread. Sturdy leg guards, and the finest chain mail, tiny hoops of shimmering steel. Then elbow guards, and metal gloves to complete the attire, with a sword fastened to a belt, by his side.

And in his armour he took a final Mass, then mounted Gringolet, his faithful, gold dressed war horse, picked up his helmet, and made ready to leave.
