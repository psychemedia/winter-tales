It was Christmas in Camelot, and all the Round Table were there.

The most chivalrous knights in all the land, the most wonderful women, the handsomest King, of highest renown.

Outside, there was jousting, and competition; inside, there was dancing, feasting and dancing, and dancing and carousing, and more feasting, as befits Christmas time, and New Year. Double portions all round, at every course. And as was the custom at the end of the year: presents.

They were also seated according to custom, in order of rank, Guinevere on the platform, alongside Arthur, with the finest tapestries hung on the wall behind. And beside them, too, Gawain, Arthur's nephew.

And they waited. For it was also Arthur's custom, on that New Year's eve, that he would not eat until a story was told of some chivalrous deed, or a challenge was made to one of the knights. And they waited. It had been a slow year...

"A story from the minstrels, then, while we wait" called the King, and a minstrel was a summoned. "Give us a tale of my father's time, of Uther Pendragon and his band of knights. A Christmas tale, if you will..."

And so, not wanting to offend any of Arthur's knights, there assembled, with tales of greater derring do from Uther's court than anything Arthur's knights had achieved throughout that year just finished, the minstrel began...

[*Sir Cleges and the Winter Cherries.* There was once a knight...] And there the minstrel's tale ended...

And with that, the bugles blared again, and more food was brought in, so fast that the tables barely had time to be cleared from one course to the next.. But while everyone there was fed as well as a man or wan could bw fed, and then some more, still King Arthur waited, for a tale of great honour, or derring do, or for a challenge to be made to one of the Court..

When suddenly, a sound, from outside, and a fearful form appeared at the door, a giant of a man, stood barefoot in the stirrups a mighty great horse.

But not just any horse....for the horse's tack, from the harness to the girth, the saddle to the stirrups, was all coloured green. And so was its hair, from its combed and knotted main, to its ribbon braided tail.

But even though he rode a war horse, he had no armour on, not even a shield, nor even a sword. Just a dark green cloak, and a dark green tunic, A dark green hood, and dark green leggings.

But that was not the strangest of it: for the stranger himself, for his long flowimg hair, and for his great bushy beard, they were also coloured the richest of greens too... And rather than a shield, he carried a sprig of holly, and rather than a sword, an axe. A *huge* axe, the mother of all axes, made of green steel and with decoration inlaid in the handle.

Looking around, he was the first to speak: "So who's the boss of this horrible rabble, then?"

And everyone just gawped, dumbstruck, and a deep, expectant hush fell on the hall, as they waited for Arthur to respond.
