PART I

It was Christmas at Camelot, and everyone was there.

The most chivalrous knights in all the land, the most wonderful women, the handsomest King, of highest renown.

Outside, there was jousting, and competition; inside, there was dancing; dancing and feasting; feasting, amd dancing, and dancing, and feasting; and carousing. There was lots of carousing; and more feasting; and more dancing; in fact, so much feasting and dancing and carousing, with double portions all round, at every course, that before anyone knew it, Christmas had almost turned into New Year.

And, as was the custom at the end of the year, there were presents. But they arenlt part of the story.

Everyone was seated, according to custom, in order of rank; Guinevere was on the platform, and alongside her, King Arthur. The finest tapestries hung on the wall behind them. And beside them, sat Gawain, King Arthur's nephew.

But for now, they waited. Because it was Arthur's custom, on that New Year's eve, that he would not eat until a story was told of some chivalrous deed, or a challenge was made to one of his knights.

And they waited.

It had been a slow year...

And they waited some more...

"A story from the minstrels, then, while we wait" called the King, and a minstrel was a summoned. "Give us a tale of my father's time, of Uther Pendragon and his band of knights. A Christmas tale, if you will..."

And not wanting to offend any of Arthur's knights on that festive night with tales of greater derring do from Uther's court than anything Arthur's men had achieved throughout that year, the minstrel began...

[*Sir Cleges and the Winter Cherries.* There was once a knight...] And there the minstrel's tale ended...

And with that, the bugles blared again, and more food was brought in, so fast that the tables barely had time to be cleared from one course to the next.

But while everyone there was fed as well as any man or woman could be fed, and then some more, still King Arthur waited, for a tale of great honour, or derring do, or for a challenge to be made to one of the Court.

And he waited...

And then, suddenly, because there'd be no story if nothing else happend, there was a mighty sound from outside; and a fearful form appeared at the door; a giant of a man; a giant of a man, stood barefoot, in the stirrups of a mighty great horse.

But not just any horse....for the horse's tack, from its harness to its girth, from its saddle to its stirrups, were all coloured green. And so was its hair: from its combed and knotted mane, to its ribbon braided tail.

But even though the huge great knight was straddling a war horse, he wasn't wearing any armour; nor was he carrying a shield; nor even a sword. Instead, he was wearing just a simple dark green cloak, and a simple dark green tunic. A dark green hood, and dark green leggings.

But that wasn't the strangest of it, not at all: for the stranger himself, from his long flowing hair, to his great bushy beard, he was completely green too.

And he laughed at the court. "Ha, haaaaa."

In place of his shield, he carried a sprig of holly; instead of his sword, an axe. A great big axe. A *huge* axe: the mother of all axes. And not just any mother of all axes. Becuase this axe was made of green steel; and inlaid in the handle, the most intricate, the most exquisite, green jeweled and green enameled decoration.

Looking around the Court, this great, Green Knight was the first to speak: "So, who's the boss of this horrible lot, then? Who's the leader of this rabble?"

And everyone gawped, dumbstruck; and a deep, expectant hush fell on the hall, as they waited for Arthur to respond.

"A warm welcome to you, sir, on this cold winter's night. I am Arthur, the head of this household. You are welcome to join us."

"Thank you, but no," said the knight. "That is not why I am here. Can you guess why I am here? You can see I am not really kitted out for war..."

And he gestured his tunic with the hand that held the holly.

And there was silence. As everyone looked at the axe.

"I was wondering: are you up for a game? Are you up for a challenge...?"

And Arthur, along with the rest of the court, assumed that he meant a fight. But that wasn't what the Green Knight had in mind at all...

<hr/>

*Well, as to what he did have in mind, you'll just have to wait to find out, until the story comes around again.*

*You may recall, it's King Arthur's court at Cameleot. A huge Green Knight has appeared, armed with an axe and a sprig of holly. He has offered a challenge, but what sort of challenge?*

Instead, he favoured a game. A Christmas game:

"A blow for a blow, with the axe, and I'll bare my neck first... and whosoever takes the strike: I'll meet them in a year and a day from now, and take my turn."

And no-one replied. Coughs went around the room, and the knights of Arthur's Court looked at the floor, and avoided the Green Knight's gaze.

And the Green Knight laughed: "So the house of King Arthur, the knights of the famed Round Table, are all a bunch of wimps?"

And as he laughed at them for their cowardice, Arthur himself stood up, enraged, and perhaps not a little embarrassed.

"No-one in this Court is afraid of that challenge", he said, "except, perhaps, for being associated with such foolishness. So give me the axe, and I'll take the blow, and let that be that, and be done with it."

But before he could take the axe, Gawain, his nephew, came leaping up.

"No sire, let *me* do it. It is not fitting for you, the King, to take on such a trifling challenge. Nor even for any of your other knights. So let me do it, the least of your men, let me take the blow."

And Gawain knelt before Arthur to receive his blessing, and the King gave him a few words of advice.

"Strike bold, and true, and you will have nothing to fear in return."

But before Gawain could take up the challenge, the Green Knight bid him to state his name, and to repeat the challenge, and to seal the covenant between them.

"I am Gawain," was the response. "I'll wield this axe now, and in a year and a day, you may strike me in return."

"Spot on", said the Green Knight. "Now, swear that you, and only you, will seek me out to return the blow."

And Gawain agreed. "But where will I find you?"

"I'll tell you when you've taken the blow', said the Green Knight. And with that, he handed over the axe, stood before Sir Gawain, heaped his long green hair onto the top of his head, and bared his neck.

Gawain took the axe, planted his feet, and swung a mighty blow, severing the spinal cord, and cleaving the Green Knight's head clean from his neck, so cleanly that the axe hit the stone floor in a shower of sparks.

The head tumbled to the floor, and the other knights kicked at it as it rolled by.

But even as the red blood spurted from the Green Knight's neck and onto the floor, his body staggered forward, the arms flailing in search of the head.

*If you've ever seen the Universiry Challenge episode of the Young Ones, when Vivien loses his head as he looks out of a train window, you can proabably imagine it in the same way that I can...*

Eventually the Green Knight's flailing arms found their target, and the knight stood up straight, holding his head beside him. He walked towards his horse, and remounted it. And as he wheeled the horse about, the blood continued to drain from the severed head and onto the floor.

As he was about to depart, he wheeled the head around to face the platform. It opened its eyes and stared straight ahead.

"Be sure to keep your word, Gawain. You will find me at the site of the Green Chapel. I am known as the Green Knight". And with that, he turned again, and was gone.

King Arthur turned to Guinevere, who was in a certain amount of shock.

"Well that was a bit a odd... But never fear, at least I can have something to eat now!"

And then he turned to Gawain, told him to hang up the mighty axe on the wall behind them, and bade everyone to eat.

And so it was that more food was brought, and the singing and the dancing resumed until late in the night, amd probably some carousing too, and the New Year dawned.

PART II

If there had been silence before, now everyone was talking about Sir Gawain's chances a year a day from then, and that is how the old year passed and the new one began.

And so the season's progrssed: the lean times of Lent came and went, and Spring waged war on Winter. Summer came around, and Autumn, and as the year passed   Michaelmas and gave way to Winter again, Gawain was reminded of his covenant and began to rouse himself, ready to set out, and find the Green Knight.

But even then he tarried, till Hallowe'en, and All Saints' Day. And again the Court feasted, as Sir Gawain made ready to take his leave of the King.

And as he left the Court, there were sounds of sadness and sorrow about the strike that Sir Gawain should take without reply.

But he remained there still, all through that All Saints' Day, but early the next morning, he called for his arms.

First, an extravagant silk tunic, then a thick warm cloak, lined with white fur. Stout steel shoes, and shiny plate to cover his knees, tied behind woith golden thread. Sturdy leg guards, and the finest chain mail, tiny hoops of shimmering steel. Then elbow guards, and metal gloves to complete the attire, with a sword fastened to a belt, by his side.

And in his armour he took a final Mass, then mounted Gringolet, his faithful, gold dressed war horse, picked up his helmet, and made ready to leave.

He was passed his scarlet shield, Ferrari red, emblazoned with a golden pentangle livery, which he slung on his back.

The pentangle was a continuous five pointed star, an eternal knot, representation of his five flawless senses, his fingers that never fumbled, his faith, founded on te five wounds Christ received on the Cross, the five joys that gave him strength, of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the birth of her son, and the five principles by which he lived: friendship, fraterniry, purity, politeness and pity.

As Gawain spurred his horse Gringolet away, with pity in their hearts and tears in their eyes.

And so he rode, and he rode, and he rode through England's realm, foraging for his food and with no friend other than his horse.

Through North Wales, to the Wirral, and everywhere he goes he asks the same question: do the people there know of a Green Chapel, or Green Knight. And always the answer is: "no; we have never heard of such a place, never heard of such a knight".

He scales steep slopes, bridges brooks, scraps with serpents and snarling wolves, wioth nars, and bulls and the occasional wild boar. But worst of all was the coming of the winter weather, the crystallised rain and the frosted, frozen ground.

And so he prays to God. And to Mary. And to Jesus Christ the Lord. And he makes the sign of the cross: once, twice, three times...

And as he does so, making his way through the frosted wood, he sees the most impressive castle ahead, with its drawbridge withdrawn, and sturdy gates, shuttered fast.

He halted Gringolet, and called out to the porter, and to the watchman on the wall. And he was greeted in return.
