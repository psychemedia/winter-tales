PART I

It was Christmas at Camelot, and everyone was there.

The most chivalrous knights in all the land, the rock stars of their day, and the racing drivers, the most beautiful women, the supermodels of the time, and of course, the royalty: all of them, hard living, fast riding, and larger than life. And with reputations to match. And chief amongst them, King Arthur, the king of highest renown.

Outside, there was jousting, and competition; inside, there was dancing; feasting and dancing; feasting, and dancing, and dancing, and feasting; and carousing. There was lots of carousing; because you can't have feasting and dancing without carousing. In fact, there was so much feasting and dancing and carousing, with double portions all round, at every course, that before anyone knew it, Christmas had almost turned into New Year. Because for now, it was New Year's Eve.

As was the custom at the end of the year, there were also presents. But presents aren't part of this story. At least, not yet.

__Everyone was seated, according to custom, in order of rank;__ Guinevere was on the platform, and alongside her, King Arthur. The finest tapestries hung on the wall behind them. And beside them, sat Gawain, Arthur's nephew.

__The food was served, as custom decrees, to each man as his station deserved.__ But for now, the King waited. Because it was his custom, on that New Year's eve, not to eat until a story had been told, of some chivalrous deed, or derring do, from amongst the knights; or for a challenge to be made against one of them.

And he waited.

It had been a slow year...

And he waited some more...

"A story from the minstrels, then, to entertain us whilst we wait", and a minstrel was a summoned. "Give us a tale of my father's time, of Uther Pendragon and his band of knights. A Christmas tale, if you will..."

So not wanting to offend any of Arthur's knights on that festive night, with tales of greater derring do from Uther's court than anything Arthur's men had achieved that year, the minstrel began...

[*Sir Cleges and the Winter Cherries.* There was once a knight...] And there the minstrel's tale ended...

And with that, the bugles blared again, and more food was brought in, so fast that the tables barely had time to be cleared from one course to the next.

But while everyone there was fed as well as any man or woman could be fed, and then some more, still King Arthur waited, for a tale of great honour, or derring do, from his own Court, or for a challenge to be made against one of his men.

And he waited...

And then, suddenly, because there'd be no story if nothing else happened, there was a mighty sound from outside; and a fearful form appeared at the door; a giant of a man; a giant of a man, standing barefoot, in the stirrups of a mighty great war horse.

But not just any horse....for the horse's tack, from its harness to its girth, from its saddle to its stirrups, they were all coloured green. As was its hair: from its combed and knotted mane, to its ribbon braided tail.

But even though the huge great knight was straddling a war horse, he wasn't wearing any armour; nor was he carrying a shield; nor even a sword. Instead, he was wearing just a simple dark green cloak, and a simple dark green tunic. A dark green hood, and dark green leggings.

But that wasn't the strangest of it, not at all: for the stranger himself, from his long flowing hair, to his great bushy beard, he was completely green too.

And he laughed at the court. "Ha, haaaaa."

In place of a shield, he carried a sprig of holly; instead of a sword, an axe. A great big axe. A *huge* great big axe: the mother of all axes. And not just any mother of all axes. Because this axe was made of glowing green steel; and inlaid in the handle, the most intricate, the most exquisite, green jeweled and green enameled decoration.

Looking around the Court, this great, Green Knight was the first to speak: "So, who's the boss of this horrible lot, then? Who's the leader of this rabble?"

And everyone just gawped, dumbstruck; and a deep, expectant hush fell on the hall, as they waited for Arthur to respond.

"A warm welcome to you, sir, on this cold winter's night. I am Arthur, the head of this household. You are welcome to join us."

"Thank you," said the knight, "but no. That is *not* why I am here."

And there was silence. As everyone else looked at the axe.

"Do not be afraid". said the knight. "You can see I am not dressed for war."

And he gestured his tunic with the hand that held the holly.

Whilst everyone else watched the axe.

"I was wondering if any of you would be up, for a game? A Christmas game. For a simple challenge...?"

<hr/>

*As to what sort of challenge he had in mind, you'll just have to wait to find out, until the story comes around again.*

*You may recall, it's King Arthur's court at Camelot. A huge Green Knight has appeared, armed with an axe and a sprig of holly. He has offered a challenge, but what sort of challenge?*

The assembled Court listened expectantly.

"A blow for a blow, with the axe, and I'll bare my neck first... and whosoever takes the strike: I'll meet them in a year and a day from now, and take my turn."

*And just in case anyone is tempted to play this game at Christmas, I'd probably recommend against it...*

No-one replied. Coughs went around the room, and the knights of Arthur's Court looked at the floor, and avoided the Green Knight's gaze.

And the Green Knight laughed: "So the house of King Arthur, the knights of the famous Round Table, are all a bunch of wimps?"

And as he laughed at them for their cowardice, King Arthur himself stood up, enraged, and perhaps not a little embarrassed.

"No-one in this Court is afraid of that challenge", he said, "except, perhaps, for being associated with such foolishness. So give me the axe, and I'll take the blow, and let that be that, and let us all be done with it."

But before he could take the axe, Gawain, his nephew, came leaping up.

"No sire, __let *me* do it__. It is not fitting for you, the King, to take on such a trifling challenge. Nor even for any of your other knights. So __let me do it__, the least of your men, let me take the blow."

And Gawain knelt before Arthur to receive his blessing, and the King gave him a few words of advice.

"Strike bold, and true, and you will have nothing to fear in return."

*That sounds a bit like the advice given at the start of the blind challenge on Bake Off, doesn't it...?*

__"Be bold, with the thyme, and make sure you cook it through."__ Whatever...

But before Gawain could take up the challenge, the Green Knight bid him to state his name, and to repeat the challenge, and to seal the covenant between them.

"I am Gawain," was the response. "I'll wield this axe now, and in a year and a day, you may strike me in return."

"Spot on", said the Green Knight. "Now, swear that you, and only you, will seek me out to return the blow."

And Gawain agreed. "But where will I find you?"

"I'll tell you when you've taken the blow", said the Green Knight. And with that, he handed over the axe, stood before Sir Gawain, heaped his long green hair onto the top of his head, and bared his neck.

Gawain took the axe, planted his feet, and swung a mighty blow, severing the spinal cord, and cleaving the Green Knight's head clean from his neck, so cleanly that the axe hit the stone floor in a shower of sparks.

The head tumbled to the floor, and the other knights kicked at it as it rolled by.

But even as the red blood spurted from the Green Knight's neck and onto the floor, his body staggered forward, the arms flailing in search of the head.

*If you've ever seen the University Challenge episode of the Young Ones, when Vivien loses his head as he looks out of a train window, you can probably imagine it in the same way that I can...*

Eventually the Green Knight's flailing arms found their target, and the knight stood up straight, holding his head beside him. He walked towards his horse, and remounted it. And as he wheeled the horse about, the blood continued to drain from the severed head and onto the floor.

As he was about to depart, he twisted the head round to face the platform. It opened its eyes and stared straight ahead.

"Be sure to keep your word, Gawain. You will find me at the site of the Green Chapel. I am known as the Green Knight". And with that, he turned again, and was gone.

King Arthur turned to Guinevere, who was in a certain amount of shock.

"Well that was a bit odd... But never fear, at least I can have something to eat now!"

And then he turned to Gawain, told him to hang up the mighty axe on the wall behind them, and bade everyone to eat.

And so it was that more food was brought, and though the singing and the dancing resumed, there was a particular silence among them, and then talking in hushed tones about Sir Gawain's chances a year a day from then.

And so again, the King called for the minstrel, for another story, to distract their attention; and sensing discomfort, the storyteller thought he would start there.

`[Juniper Tree]`

And with the minstrel's story over, the evening celebrations came to an end, at King Arthur's Court, in Camelot, and as the last of them made their way to bed, the New Year dawned.

PART II

The old year had passed and the new one had begun.

And so the season's progressed: the lean times of Lent came and went, and Spring waged war on Winter. Summer came around, and Autumn, and as the year passed Michaelmas and gave way to Winter again, Gawain was reminded of his covenant and began to rouse himself, ready to set out, and find the Green Knight.

But even then he tarried, till Hallowe'en, and All Saints' Day. And again the Court feasted, as Sir Gawain made ready to take his leave of the King.

And as he left the Court, there were sounds of sadness and sorrow about the strike that Sir Gawain should take without reply.

But he remained there still, all through that All Saints' Day, and early the next morning, he called for his arms.

First, an extravagant silk tunic, then a thick warm cloak, lined with white fur. Stout steel shoes, and shiny plate to cover his knees, tied behind with golden thread. Sturdy leg guards, and the finest chain mail, tiny hoops of shimmering steel. Then elbow guards, and metal gloves to complete the attire, with a sword fastened to a belt, by his side.

He took a final Mass, then mounted Gringolet, his faithful, gold dressed war horse.

He was passed his helmet, and his scarlet shield, Ferrari red, emblazoned with golden pentangle livery, a symbol of his five flawless senses, his fingers that never fumbled, his faith, founded on the five wounds Christ received on the Cross, the five joys that gave him strength, of the Blessed Virgin Mary at the birth of her son, and the five principles by which he lived: friendship, fraterniry, purity, politeness and pity, and he slung it on his back.

As then his spurred Gringolet away, and their was pity in the hearts and tears in the eyes of the people who saw him go.

And so he rode, and he rode, and he rode through England's realm, foraging for his food and with no friend other than his horse.

Through North Wales, to the Wirral, and everywhere in between, and everywhere he goes he asks the same question: do the people there know of a Green Chapel, or Green Knight? And always the answer is the same: "no; we have never heard of such a place, we have never heard of such a knight".

He scales steep slopes, bridges brooks, scraps with serpents and snarling wolves, battles with bears, and bulls and the occasional wild boar. But worst of all was the coming of the winter weather, the crystallised rain and the frosted, frozen ground.

And so he prays to God. And to Mary. And to Jesus Christ the Lord. And he makes the sign of the cross: once, twice, three times...

And as he does so, making his way through the frosted wood, he sees the most impressive castle ahead, with its drawbridge withdrawn, and sturdy gates, shuttered fast.

He halted Gringolet, called out to the porter, and to the watchman on the wall.

And he was greeted in return.

"Could you take a message to the master of this place? Would he grant me shelter?"

And the porter replied: "most certainly."

And before Gawain knew it, the drawbridge was lowered, and the was gate opened, and Gawain rode into the castle.

He was relieved of his shield, and his sword, and his helmet, and was taken inside, then well met by the Lord, with a hard, fiery face, and bushy red beard:

"You are most welcome, so come in, come in, and make yourself at home."

Gawain was shown to his room, finely furnished with the riches tapestries, and curtains.

He removed his armour, now rusted and weather beaten, and was presented instead with a fine set of robes.

He returned to the hall, and was seated by a roaring red fire, that he might thaw out from the cold.

A table was set and a feast laid before him. The finest fish dishes that Gawain had ever seen, let alone eaten.

Then question followed question and Gawain answered politely, admitting his name, that he was one of Arthur's Round Table.

And everyone there was suitably impressed, for never had they had such a celebrity in their midst, a knight of legend and lore.

Day became dusk, and the meal came to an end. The bells sounded evensong, and as everyone made their way to pray, Gawain went with them.

Accompanying the Lord, his Lady, who, to Gawain's eye, seemed fairer even than the fair Queen, Guinevere.

As they left the Church, the Lady was hand in hand with another woman, much older, withered and well advanced in years, her cheeks waddled and slack compared to the bloom of her younger, and fairer, companion. There was just no comparison. And Gawain and the fair Lady exchanged courtesies.

With the Lord's blessing, Gawain approached the two maidens, the fair and the foul, and they took him between them, arm in arm, and led him away, talking as they walked.

And again, they sat by the fire, and feasted on cake and the finest wine, until it was time for bed.

The next day dawned, and again there were banquets and buffets.

__Everyone was seated, according to custom, in order of rank.__ The ancient old crone was sat at the high table next to the Lord, and Gawain sat next to the younger. And __the food was served, as custom decrees, to each man as his station deserved__. And throughout the meal, Gawain and the fair Lady, chatted and conversed and muttered sweetly to each other.

The next day, they drank, and danced, and the next, and the next day after that too. St John's Day passed and the Christmas feasting was coming to a close. In the greyness of the following day, the guests were to take their leave, and so Gawain began to make his goodbyes; but though it was late, he was ushered into the host's own chamber, and thanked for visiting and so honouring his house.

And then the Lord of that place asked Sir Gawain if he might impose on him, and ask him what mission it was that he was on that should keep him away from Camelot at Christmas time?

And Gawain explained to him his quest: to find the Green Chapel, and the Green Knight, but he knew not where to begin. And time was running out. For he told of the covenant with the Green Knight, the blow for a blow that was to be finally exchanged on New Year's Day, just three more days away.

And the Lord laughed, and smiled. "Don't worry yourself", he said, "I know the place, it is but a short ride away from here. So stay until New Year's Day, and I'll have you led there at the dawn of the New Year."

And at this news, Gawain was overjoyed, and swore himself to the service of the Lord until that time; and the Lord called for the ladies to join them, and they continued to share good cheer and conversation deep into the early hours of the morning.

And the Lord praised Gawain for joining in their festivities night after night, even though he must have been tired from his journey; and told him to have a lie in that morning, whilst he, the Lord, went out hunting. And his wife, the young Lady, would keep him company all day.

But the Lord also bade Gawain to join him in a pact, in a wager. "Whatever I take in the hunt tomorrow, shall be yours. But in return, you will give me whatever you gain during the day." An odd request, but Gawain agreed - he had bid himself to the service of the Lord, after all. And they sealed the pact with a toast, and when it came time to go to bed, they repeated the pact again. But who knew what game was afoot...

PART III

Before sunrise, the servants stirred, and made ready the horses for those who would hunt. After __mass, and a quick early breakfast__, the hunters cantered off on their chosen course, the Lord amongst them. And as they rode out, the bugles blared. And the hunt was on.

The wild creatures of the forest quaked with fear, not least among them, the deer. For though the male of that kind was not to be hunted in the close season, the hinds were fair game. And the arrows flew, and the hunting was good indeed, and many a kill was had that day. (These were different times!)

__Meanwhile, back at the castle,__ Gawain lay snug and warm in his bed, surrounded by curtains and under a mountain of covers.

When suddenly, he hears a sound, like the door to his room being quietly opened. He peeks through the curtains and sees the Lady, the beautiful one, creep in, and close the door.

Obviously, he does what __any virtuous knight would do__, and pretends to be asleep. Silently, the Lady creeps towards the bed, opens the curtains, ans sits herself on the edge.

Gawain continues to pretend to be asleep, hoping she'll go away.

But she doesn't She just sits there, gently stroking the bed clothes. And waits.

After a while, Gawain realises she isn't about to go anywhere in a hurry, and so he does what __any virtuous knight would do,__ and pretends to wake up, starts to stretch, and then feigns being startled to see her there.

And smiling sweetly at him, she beings to speak:

"Good morning, Sire. How deeply you seem to sleep... But now I have you trapped!" and with that, she pins him down beneath the bed clothes.

"Erm, good morning, my Lady" he stammers, as any virtuous knight would do. "I... how might I help you? If you just let me get up and get dressed, I'll gladly be at your service."

But still she pinned him down. "That won't be necessary, *Sir* Gawain, who is feared through the land, yet seems to be trapped by a mere lady" and she giggled again. "And with my husband out all day.... And the servants all asleep... And my maids probably with them. The door is bolted, so I'll take my time, and I expect you will do what you will..."

Now, as __any virtuous knight would do__, Sir Gawain stifled back an embarrassed cough, and struggling for something else to say, thanked the Lady for praising him so, but said he was not so worthy.

"Oh, but if you are Gawain, you surely are..." and she sang his praises again.

"I thank you again", said Sir Gawain, "but I hardly merit such respect. Whereas you, erm, you are truly... joyful, and... generous..." and he flattered her as some form of self-defence.

And so it was, pinned down as he was, he deflected each of her advances, and avoided each of her approaches, until at last she said she would leave him in peace...

And then laughed and bade her farewell. "I was right..." she said, "you could never be Sir Gawain..."

And to that he took affront. "But why-ever not, my Lady?"

"I have heard the stories", she said, "of you knights of the Round Table. How the real Sir Gawain never even crave a kiss after such a lovely time together.."

"But my Lady", he said, "I never meant to offend...", but before he could finish, she had returned to the bedside and given him a single goodbye kiss.

And promptly left.

Gawain jumped out of bed, and pulled on some clothes __— and whether he had a cold shower first I surely don't know — and headed off to Mass, *and then a leisurely breakfast*__, where he was seated between the Lady, and the old crone, and all was good between them.

__Back on the hunt, in the forest, the Lord was still leading the chase against the *hinds*.__ And finally, with the dogs run out and the horses tired from the chase, they survey their kill. They pick the finest deer, they __*butcher it* there and then, feeding the scraps and the offal to the dogs as they do so__. And with that, __the kill horn is blown, and the hunt is ended__, and they haul the meat home.

The whole of the household was summoned into the hall, and the venison revealed to the assembled crowd. and in particular, to Sir Gawain, who said he had never seen anything like it before, let alone out of season.

"And it's all yours", said the Lord, "as per our agreement. What I won on the hunt, I give to you."

"And I shall give to what I received here, in turn," said Gawain, and he walked up to the Lord, and gave him a kiss.

"A fancy thing", said the Lord. "But how did you come by it?"

And Gawain just smiled. "That was *not* part of our bargain", he replied.

And so they lounged by the fire, and feasted, and agreed to the same game again, on the morrow, each of their takings to be traded at day's end.

And the drinking continued, and eventually they went to bed.

But even though they had been up late, by the third cock's crow, the Lord was up for __mass, and a quick, early breakfast__, and out on the hunt. Before long, the hounds had picked up on the scent of a mighty wild boar, bigger than the biggest of big things, even as wild boars go, and whenever the men got near, it fought back in return, and mauled many of the men with its gleaming white tusks. And even their arrows bounced off its thick, tough hide.

The boar is cornered again, and again breaks free, and heads in to the forest, pursued by the Lord alone.

__Meanwhile, back at the castle,__ a door quietly opens, and the Lady creeps in. parts the curtains round the bed, and peeps in. She giggles girlishly, as Gawain greets her, and she gently teases him again.

"Did you not learn your lesson yesterday, Sir Knight? To claim a kiss quickly, when one is required?"

And carefully Gawain replied, "Dear Lady, I dare not, lest a kiss be declined."

"But someone as strong and powerful as you could easily force a kiss on one such as I..."

"And what would that make me? Such behaviour goes against my grain. But as you request, I cannot deny", and with that, the fair lady gave him the sweetest morning kiss.

"Now tell me", said the Lady, "you knights are well known for your lusty liaisons and amorous affairs. But you? You have not spoken of love at all? Surely one so well versed in such exploits should be able to instruct an innocent lady such as I in the lessons of love, before my husband gets home from the hunt?"

Not wanting the offend the Lady, Gawain was careful in his reply: "You flatter me indeed. But to explain love to you. I sense you have more insight, and skill, in such arts than I do..."

And so the Lady continued to tease him and to tempt him, and Gawain defended himself and deflected her advances, avoiding whatever mischief she had in mind.

And at length, she laughed, and as left, she gave Gawain a second sweet kiss of the day.

Gawain roused himself and rose out of bed __— and whether he had a cold shower first I surely don't know — and headed off to Mass, *and a leisurely breakfast*__, then loitered with the ladies throughout the day.

__Back on the hunt, in the forest, the Lord was still leading the chase against the *wild boar*.__ Eventually, it was backed in a hole by a stony rise at the side of a stream, his tusks to the front, the hunters waited, afraid of what the boar might do to them.

His Lordship arrives, spots the boat, and dismounts. With his sword in his hand, he advances.

The boar leaps forward, its hair bristling, and man and beast both tumble into the white water.

But the boar comes of worst, and the Lord finds his mark. and the boar's neck is sliced through.

The white water frothed red, and the boar floated downstream, then recovered and dragged to the bank, and the dogs bring on its death.

__The kill horn is blown, and the hunt is ended__; the boar is __*butchered* there and then, *with* the scraps and the offal *being fed* to the dogs__; and with that, the kill was carried home, with the boar's head leading the way at the front of them.

Once again, the Lord is excited when he sees Gawain, calls for the ladies, and shares his tale of the kill. And Gawain compliments him, rightly. The Lord hands over the giant hog's head, and the rest of the kill, in accord with the covenant between them.

And in return Gawain grabs the shoulders of the Lord, and kisses, once, them twice, in return. "And now, we're even."

Once again, the tables are assembled, and covered with fine cloth. Places are set, and supper is served, and after the feast, song is followed by song.

And the younger Lady, and Gawain, are sat, side by side, stolen glances, and secret smiles; and it drove him half mad.

But he could not snub her, and though tongues might wag, he returned her affection.

And as the rest of the party retired for bed, the Lord gestures again for Sir Gawain to tarry a while longer by the hearth and the fire.

They supped and swapped stories, and if we had time now, I would tell you some of them, when again Gawain raised the question of his quest, and again the Lord told him he had plenty of time, that he should stay another night. And that they should play their game again, for a third time, on the morrow.

And then they retired, but before too long, the Lord was again up and made ready for the hunt. He took __mass, and a quick, early breakfast__, and called for his mount.

The fields were dazzling, with an early morning frost, the sunrise scarlet in the cloud scudded sky.

As the hunters reached the forest, the dogs were set free. They scented a fox, and picked up his trail. And they were led a merry chase, with the fox in the lead, first this way, then that, and then the other.

Each time the dogs close, he somehow outwits them, that crafty Reynard, and it seems as if this chase will go on forever.

__Meanwhile, back at the castle,__ Gawain snoozes and the Lady cannot sleep. She rises, and despite the chill in the air, rushes to his room, dressed in a long flowing robe, but unhooded, her neck naked, and her shoulders bare to front and back.

She strides into his room, and throws open the window, "Oh, how can you sleep on such a beautiful morning?!", but still he dozes and dreams of impending fate in the Green Chapel. Then, sensing her presence, he startles awake, and cannot but notice her low cut dress.

He feels his passions stir, but remains polite, as she presents him with the first kiss of the day. And then they chat and talk tenderly to each other, as good friends, who are comfortable with each other, do.

But even so, every so often, she tempts him again, pushing him closer to the edge, where he must accept her love, or politely refuse her.

But he remains courteous, not sinful, and swears to himself not to succumb.

He parried her passes and deflected her advances, the loving phrases that leapt from her lips, and shes asks him: "is it me? Or is there someone else?"

It's time for him to tread carefully... "No, there's no-one else; and there won't be for some time yet..."

Which is *exactly* the *wrong* thing to say...

"Do you know how insulting that is?! But I suppose I asked for it... So if I muse mourn, then at least let me have a kiss as a memory of out time together..."

And with that, she gave him the second kiss of the day.

"But will you also give me a small gift to remember you by?"

"Oh, I would that I could, but I came with nothing of values and focused purely on my mission."

"No matter," she said, "have mine..."

And she proffered him a ring, of rich, red gold, with a shiny jewel inlaid.

"I could not accept such a gift.. for I have nothing to offer in return."

But she insists, "here take it" and he resits again, "I thank you, but no, it is too precious a thing."

"Then take this", she says, and she takes of her belt, a girdle of green silk, its edges trimmed with gold.

But still he refuses.

"Oh, so is this *not good enough*, then? It's not as simple as it seems, you know. It's not just *any old girdle*. This is a magic girdle, a *powerful* girdle, a *guardian girdle*. Because anyone who wears it will be protected from any mortal strike, or blow..."

Oops...

As she turns away, the thoughts of dread that troubled his dreams return to him. Maybe he had been a little hasty.

So when she offers him the girdle one final time — "are you *sure* you won't take it?" —  he relents. But as he takes the belt, she begs hi, "but please don't tell my husband..."

And then, with one last kiss, the third of the day, she departs.

Gawain clothed himself quickly, in the richest of robes, the love-lace hidden inside, and heads off the chapel, for confession and absolution. And then, in a merrier mood, he heads off the find the ladies.

__Back on the hunt,__ in the forest, the Lord and his men were still being led on a fruitless chase by the wily Reynard. But eventually, the Lord closes in on the tiring fox, and swipes at it with his sword. But it jumps away, and even though his misses, one dog catches it, then another. But the Lord reaches down, and wrestles it away, before they rip it apart, and he holds it high, above his head, as a trophy, and __the kill horn is blown, and the hunt is ended__.

As the night draws in, they set off back home. Barely has the Lord entered the hall when Gawain gets up from beside the fire and strides towards, clasps him tight on the shoulders, and gives him three kisses.

"By God, you've had some luck today":, says the Lord, "whilst I have in return is this stinking fox, and he drops it to the floor.

And with that, their game is over. The minstrels start up, and the food is brought out, and the wine flows freely. And every one has too much to drink.

Eventually, it is time for bed. Gawain thanks the Lord for his generosity, and asks again that someone might lead him to the Green Chapel in the morning. And with that agreed, Gawain takes his leave; and with a heavy he heart, he thanks the other guests too, for their hospitality, for making him so welcome, and they thank him in return.

And so it is, with tapering torchlight, he makes his way to bed. But who would expect our knight to sleep soundly, on such a night, given the challenge he must face in the morning.

PART IV

Outside, a freezing North wind drifts the white snow. Inside, Gawain lies awake with his thoughts, sleeping little. Each crow of the cock brings his destiny nearer. He gets up before dawn, and dresses warmly to fend of the chill of his armour. now biffed and burnished and raked free of rust, gleaming as good as new.

And then he sends for his horse, for Gringolet.

Under his clothes, the Lady's girdle, that magic belt that he hopes will afford him protection.

Gringolet is brought to him, and as he leaves the castle for the first and last time, he prays to Christ to keep it well.

The drawbridge is lowered, and the gates are opened. He thanks the porter, and the guard on the walls.

He rides off with an escort, a guide, to show him the way, and together they ride over moors and misty mountains, the hill tops hidden in wintery mizzle. And they ride through the snow littered land.

"We are nearing the place now", says the guide, "but it is a place of great peril. A wild man lives there, a man without mercy, and none ever return. We can turn back now - I won't tell anyone."

But Gawain is resolute. "If I don't keep the covenant, I'll forever be known as a coward. So I'll take my chances, and go on to the Green Chapel."

"On your own head. be it", said the guide, perhaps not realising the black humour of his remark. ""Follow that rocky ridge ahead, and descend into the valley. There's a glade to the left, and a clearing. And there you'll find the Green Chapel. But I will go no further", and with that, he wheeled his horse about, and was gone.

Gawain presses ahead, and descends through the ravine. It is a wild place. When he reaches the bottom, he looks for the Green Chapel, but sees no such thing. He looks again, and makes out a strange, green mound. He approaches it, and circles it. There is a hole at one end, a door maybe?, and its walls are matted with weeds and moss.

"A Green Church, or perhaps a Devil's lair?" and he says a quick prayer to himself.

Never had he seen a sight so cursed.

Nor heard such a painful, screeching sound, that came the hillside: the scrape of a scythe being ground against stone. And Gawain knows it for exactly what it is: his greeting. The Green Knight sharpening his axe.

Gawain calls out, to grab his attention: "Who has power in this place, to honour our pact? It is now, or never, a year and a day see our agreement was made."

"Hang on...." came the reply, "and you'll get what's coming to you. I just need to sharpen this last bit..."

Then through the crags he comes, the Green Knight, brandishing his gleaming edged axe, a handle the size of a staff, and he leaps across a stream.

"Welcome to my domain. You've timed it well. And I see you came alone. As have I. Now, remove you helmet, and take what you're owed, with no more struggle than I gave."

And Gawain lowered his head, and bared his neck, and braced himself for the blow.

The Green Knight summoned his strength, raised the axe high above his it, and swung it down. But as he did so, Gawain flinched, the Green Knight diverted the blow.

"What was that? You moved? Are you a wimp, or knight?"

And Gawain apologised, "I'm sorry, I won't fail again. So be brisk, and get it over with. I'll not flinch again."

And again, for a second time, the Green Knight raises his axes, commences the blow, but again he swerves and leaves Gawain, stood rock solid, completely unscathed.

"Ha ha, that's more like it. Much braver. Now I'll serve you your blow properly."

"Just get on with it," snarled Gawain. "You've had your fun. So stop faffing around, and do your worst."

The axe is raised, and a ferocious blow is swung, but skews to the side at the very last moment and just *nicks* the side of Gawain's neck. A spot of blood speckles the snow white ground with red. and Gawain leaps aside. He grabs his helmet, and shield and brandishes his sword.

"Enough of this — you've had your turn. A blow for a blow, our covenant is done, and if you strike again, I'll return it in kind."

The Green Knight steps back, and leans against his axe.

"Be less feisty, young man. One strike was promised, so consider it served. My first strike was a feint, in return for our first night's game, where you gave up gains as you promised you would. The second night was the same, when you returned my pretty wife's two kisses. But the third night, you strayed: and for that, you had to pay. And he cleaned away the drops of blood from the axe.

"That belt you wear... and I know you do... that belt was woven by my wife. I know of the courtesies you shared with her, the *wooing*, the *kisses*, all whilst I was gone. Because it was me who sent her... to test you. And you behaved well. Until the last. But to love your life so, I cannot fault you for that."

And Gawain blushed red with shame: "a curse upon my cowardice, that destroyed my virtue", and he fumbles at his mail, and takes off the belt underneath. That was my undoing — may the Devil take it."

And the Green Knight laughed: "there is no harm done. Your penance is paid," — and he gestured the axe — "and by your confession you are set free".

"And this gold edged girdle his yours", he said, as he picked it up from the ground where Gawain had thrown it. "A reminder of our meeting, a keepsake from this Chapel. Now follow me home, and we shall continue our celebrations, where you can re-meet my wife as a friend, and not a foe."

But Gawain wouldn't join him. "I've been away for long enough already. Commend me to your wife, who kidded me so cunningly. It's no surprise that men are so easily led. If only we could love our ladies without being seduced by their wiles...

"But I will accept the girdle, and thank your for the gift. I will wear it as a sign of my sin. But I would ask you one thing: what is your name?"

"My name is Bertilak. Bertilak de Hautdesert. And in my house lives Morgan le Fay. Your aunt. The half sister of Arthur. Who was trained by Merlin and is a mistress of the dark arts.

"She was the one who guided me, sent me to Camelot a year and a day ago, to test the Round Table and put you on trial. She imagined the nightmares that Guinevere would have of the headless knight, So, come back to the castle, come and greet your aunt."

But Gawain would not, and so they took their leave of each other and each went their own way.

Through the wilds of England, Gawain rode on Gringolet, taking shelter where he could. He wore the green belt as a sash, diagonally, as a sign of his sin.

And eventually, he returned to Camelot, to King Arthur's Court, and he told them the tale I have told you.

Of you the long cold journey, of the castle, and the Lord. The two ladies, fair and foul, and the thrice played game. Of his fall, and the reward that was dealt him i his turn. And he touched he neck, where the axe had grazed. And he told them of the belt, the green girdle, edged with gold.

And the King gave him comfort, and the knights all agreed that they too would wear such a sash.

And so it was, and so it is, and so we end our tale. Of Camelot, and King Arthur, and of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

*For honest is he who shows penance.*
