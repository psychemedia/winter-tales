# Storynotes Elsewhere

Whilst I prefer telling tales more or less as I remember hearing them told, keeping that oral transmission thing going, I also dig into the history of the tale, seeking variants, and often borrowing bits from them if they make the story work better for me.

Several of the stories I tell are thematically grouped, and if perhaps they started out being recorded here, I then migrate them from this collection into the appropriate thematic collection.

I've also started poking around contemporary reports of historical events, looking for the tales as told at the time that might perhaps lead to a story of how the event played out, or was understaood at the time.

Some of my other storynotes collections:

- [Storytelling notes](https://psychemedia.github.io/storytelling-notes/preface.html) â€” *bits and bobs with no other place to go... Sometimes these tales also migrate elsewhere...*
- [Isle of Wight Storynotes](https://psychemedia.github.io/island-storynotes/preface.html)
- [In Search of Fionn MacCumhaill and the Fianna](https://psychemedia.github.io/finn-resources/preface.html)
