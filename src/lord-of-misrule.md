Western Gazette - Friday 30 December 1938
"LORD OF MISRULE" CHRISTMAS CUSTOMS OF THE MIDDLE AGES WHEN RELATIONSHIPS WERE TURNED UPSIDE DOWN [BY ISABEL WYATT.] The Lord of Misrule was the officer appointed in the courts and castles of mediaeval times to act as master of the revels at Christmas-time. As regard his origin, Fraser, in his Golden Bough, deduces from the rude, boisterous, and topsy-turvy nature of the revels that the Lord of Misrule was the Christian descendant of the pagan King of the Roman Saturnalia; certainly the revels themselves had much in common with the Saturnalia, and the Lord of Misrule with the King who represented Saturn. Snell says, in his Customs of Old England: " The distinctive feature of the Saturnalia was the inversion of ordinary relationships; the world was turned upside down, and the licence that prevailed, by dint of long usage and inviolable sentiment, imparted to the merry-making a rough and even immoral character. Slaves assumed the position of masters, and masters of slaves; and the general nature of the observances is aptly described by the patron deity in Lucian's play on the subject: ' During my reign of a week no one may attend to his business, but only to drinking, singing, playing. making imaginary kings, playing servants at table with their masters.' The advent of Christianity was impotent to arrest the annual scenes of disorder; and in some form or another the tradition held its own down through the Dark Ages, and we meet with the substance of the Saturnalia in burlesque festivals during the centuries immediately preceding the Reformation."

MISRULE CONTROLLED BY LAW.

The dates of the Saturnalia approximated with those of the Christmas festival, beginning on December 17th and continuing for a week. By the sixteenth century we find that the reign of the Lord of Misrule had been extended at both ends, so that it began as early as All Hallows Eve, and did not end until Candlemas. Great Britain even has some legislation concerned with these mockmonarchs; in 1555 for example, an Act was passed, severely curtailing the enormous expense entailed by the Lords of Misrule of the Tudor mayor and sheriffs of London, while in the same year an Act was passed suppressing them altogether in Scotland, where they were known as the Abbots of Unreason. Sir Walter Scott, in *The Abbot*, introduces an Abbot Unreason, explaining in his notes: " The Roman Catholic church connived at the frolics of the rude vulgar, who, in almost all Catholic countries, enjoyed, or at least assumed, the privilege of making some Lord of the Revels, who, under the name of the Abbot of Unreason, the Boy-Bishop, or the President of Fools, occupied the churches, profaned the holy places by a mock imitation of the sacred rites, and sang indecent parodies of the hvmns of the church."

"FROLICKSOME MONARCH."

Some of the varied functions of what Strutt has called " this frolicksome monarch" are suggested by the following gleanings from some of the old writers. Leland says, writing in 1489: " This Christmas I saw no disguiseings at court, and right few playes; but there was an Abbot of Misrule that made much sport, and did right well his office." Stow says, in his *Survey of London*: "At the feast of Christmas there was in the king's house, wherever chanced to reside, a Lord of Misrule appointed, to be master of merry disports. And the like had ye in the house of every nobleman of honour or good worship, were he spiritual or temporal. And among the rest, the lord mayor of London and the sheriffs had severally of them their Lord of Misrule, ever contending, without quarrel or offence, who should make the rarest pastimes to delight the beholders. This pageant potentate began his rule Allhallow eve, and continued the same till the morrow after the Feast of the Purification, in which space there were fine and subtle disguisings, masks, and mummeries."

Holinshed, writing in 1578, says in his *Chronicles of England*: " What time there is alwayes one appointed to make sporte at courte called commonly Lorde of Misrule, whose office is not unknowne to such as have bene brought up in noblemens houses and among great housekeepers, which use liberal feasting in the season;" and he tells of how one George Ferrers, in the fifth year of King Edward VI., " so well supplied his office, both of shew of sundry sights and devises of rare invention and in act of divers interludes and matters of pastime played by persons, as not only satisfied the common sorte but also were verie well liked and allowed by the council and others of skill in lyke pastimes; but best by the young himselfe, as appeared by his princely liberalitie in rewarding that service."

A QUAINT DESCRIPTION.

That the Lord of Misrule spread from aristocratic circles until he was to found misruling the revels of prince and peasant alike is shown by Stubbs, who, writing in 1595, says in his *Anatomie of Abuses*: " First of all, the wild heades of the parish flocking togither, chuse them a graund Captaine of Mischiefe, and him they crowne with great solemnity and adopt him for their kinge. This kinge annoynted chuseth forth twentie, fourtie, threescore, or an hundred lustie guttes like to himself to waite upon his lordlie majestie and to guarde his noble person. Then every one of these men he investeth with his liveries of greene, yellow, or some other light wanton colour, and as though they were not, gaudy ynough. they bedecke themselves with scarffes, ribbons, and laces, hanged all over with gold ringes, pretious stones, and other jewels. This done, they tie aboute either legge twentie or fourtie belles, with riche handkexchiefes in their handes and sometimes laide acrosse over their shoulders and neckes, borrowed for the most part, of their pretie mopsies and loveing Bessies. Thus all thinges set in order, then have they their hobby horses, their dragons, and other antiques, together with their baudie pipers and thundring drummers, to strike up the devil's daunce with all. Then march this heathen companie towards the church, their pypers pyping, their drummers thundring, their stum pes dauncing, their belles jyngling, their handkerchiefes fluttering aboute their like madde men, their hobbie horses and other monsters skirmishing amongst the throng: and in this sorte they go to the church, though the minister be at prayer or preaching, dauncing, and singing like devils incarnate, with such confused noise that no man can heare his owne voyce. Then the foolish people they looke, they stare, they laugh, they fleere. and mount upon the formes and pewes see these goodly pageants solemnized. Then after this, aboute the church they go againe and againe, and so fourthe into the churche yard, where they have commonly their sommer-halls their bowers, arbours, and banquetting-houses set up, wherein they feast, banquet, and daunce all that day, and paradventure all that night too; and thus these terrestial furies spend the sabbath day. Then, for the further innobling of this honourable lardane. they have certaine papers wherein is painted some babelerie or other of imagerie worke, and these they call my Lord of Misrule's badges or cognizances. These they give to every one that will give them money maintaine them in this their heathenish devilrie; and who will not show himself buxome to them and give them money, they shall be mocked and flouted shamefully; yea. and many times carried upon a cowlstaffe, and dived over heade and eares water, or otherwise most horribly abused. And so besotted are some that they not only give them money but weare their badges or cognizances in their hates or cappes openly. Another sorte of fantasticall fooles bring to these helhounds, the Lord of Misrule and his complices, some bread, some good ale, some new cheese some old cheese, some custardes. some cracknels, some cakes, some flauns, some tartes, some creame, some meat, some one thing, and some another."

SPREAD TO THE SUMMER.

It would seem from this that Stubbs was not one of those who looked upon the Lord of Misrule with an indulgent eye! It would also seem that the dominion of the Lord of Misrule had not only spread down the social scale but had also spread along the seasons since he and his retainers had their "sommerhalls' in the churchyard, and spent not only the day there, but the night also. This explains why. although the Lord of Misrule was originally a Christmas potentate, a Puritan writer in Commonwealth times writes of him thus: "On May-days the folk would choose them a Lord of Misrule, whom they would follow even into the church, dancing, and swinging their may-boughs like very devils " It was about this little parish prince of the May-day and not of the Christmas revels, that Alfred Noyes wrote his famous and light-hearted poem *The Lord of Misrule*, in which

"Like a sunlit sea-wave,  
A green and crimson sea-wave,  
A frolic of madcap May-folk  
Came whooping through the door."

and

" High in the old oak pulpit  
This Lord of all Misrule—  
I think it was Will Summers  
That once was Shakespeare's fool"—

preached the Lord of Misrule's sermon:

"This is the sign we bring you  
Before the darkness fall:  
We tell you He is risen again.  
Our God hath burst his prison again.  
The Lord of life is risen again.  
And love is Lord of all."

THE LORD OF MISRULE IN OLDEN TIMES.

His lordship seems have been very doubtful character, for many —especially divines— abuse him roundly, whilst others are equally vehement in his praise. He seems to have been no mean man for his short time of power. At Cambridge and Oxford, this Christmas prince was annually elected by the Fellows from among themselves, and his sovereignty lasted for twelve days. The societies of law also had their Lord of Misrule; and the Lord Mayor of London and the sheriffs severally appointed their "Masters of Merry Disports.” The Lords of Misrule did not even end here. They would appear to have been as numerous as those other Lords of Misrule who throng the House of Peers, "for," says Stowe, "there was in the King’s house, wheresoever lodged, a Lord of Misrule, and the like had ye in the house of every nobleman of honour or good worship, were he spiritual temporal."

What enormities these unruly lords were guilty of not explained by history, but their misdeeds seem to have been heavy and numerous; for, from their high position, they fell into great disrepute, and eventually were suppressed by an alarmimg proclamation issued by Henry the Eighth. The bishops had long since given them up; the inns of law and the colleges had declared that the sports were inconsistent with the discipline of the students. Reverend gentlemen had denounced these lords and their associates in language which, unless it had been uttered by clerical lips, we should almost be tempted to call coarse. “They have their hobbiehorses, dragons, and other antiques, together with their dirtie pipers and thunderyng drummers; then march these neathen companies towards the churchyards, their pipers pipyng, drummers thunderyng, their stumppes danacying, their belles jyngling, their handkerchiefs swyngyng about their heades like madmen, their hobbie-horses and other monsters skyrmyshyng amongst the throng like imps incarnate." Another divine denounced these "Bacchanalian Christmasses" on account of their " manner of solemnising being spent in revelling, epicurisme, wantonnesse, idleness, dancing, drinking, stage-plaies, masques, and carnale pompe and jollity." The custom, however, was not entirely suppressed until Henry the Eighth issued his thunder. It was "ordejned that if any persons did disguise themselves in apparel and cover their faces with visors, gathering a company together, naming themselves mummers, which used to come to the dwelling-places of men of honour and other substantiall persons, whereupon murders, felonie, and other great hurt, and inconveniences have aforetime grown, and hereafter be like to come, by the colour thereof, if the sayde disorder shonld continue not reformed, &c. ; that then they should be arrested by the king's liege people as vagabonds, and be committed to the gaole without ball or mainprise for the space of three months."

The best account we have of one of these exhibitions is that given by Warton of the show that annnaily took place in the Temple. The elected prince would assume a variety of titles. He would call himself—The most magnificent and renowed William, by the favour fortune, Prince of Whitefriara, Lord of Blacfriars, High Regent of Bouverie-street, Duke of St Dunstan, Marquis of Thames, Landgrave of Fetter-lane, Count Palatine of Pump-court, Chief Bailiff of Essex street, High Ruler of Chancery-lane, Governor of the Stairs, sole Commander of all Titles, Tournaments, and Triumphs, Superintendent all Solemnities whatever. The mock monarch was, during his twelve days’ reign, attended by his lord keeper, lord treasurer, with eight white staves, a captain of his band of pensioners, and of his guard. He had two chaplains, who, when they preached before him in the Temple Church, were considered to behave disrespectfully, unless, on ascending the pulpit, they saluted his lordship with three low bows. When the great man dined, either in the hall or in his privy chamber, it was under a cloth of estate. Some good-natured nobleman was obliging enough to lend him the pole-axes carried by his gentlemen pensioners, and the Lord Chief Justice for the time being was expected to send in the venison required for the guests. The most expensive item in the supplies—the wine—fell to the lot of the Lord Mayor and sheriffs. As these roysterers always drink copiously, there must have been few cart-loads of empty bottles to carry away when the twelve days’ drinking was over. On Twelfth Day, at going to church, his Lordship of Misrule received many petitions, which he gave to his Master of Requests, and like other potentates thought no more of them. He also, mimicking the custom of kings, had a favourite, whom, with other gentlemen of high quality, he knighted on returning from church. Now comes the most serious portion of this jocose description. The poor fool who had been this twelve days' monarch had to pay the expenses of the entertainment, and they seldom amounted to less than two thousand pounds. As a salve for this heavy bleeding, the real king at Whitehall knighted the mock king from the Temple.

One George Ferrers, a sucking Lincoln's Inn barrister, had the honour of appearing in his celebrated part as the Lord of Misrule before King Edward VI, when that excellent and learned young monarch kept Christmas and open house— excellent things —at Greenwich. It is reported that his Majesty was much delighted in the diversion, and ordered an excellent sapper to be served to the merry tomfools.

South London Observer - Saturday 10 January 1880
A LORD OF MISRULE IN OLDEN TIME. On the 12th Janaary, 1627, the Templars having resolved on celebrating the festivals of Misrule, chose as their Lord for the occasion a Mr. Palmer, who, late at night, went into Fleet-street to collect his rents. A every door the jovial collectors winded the Temple horn, and if at the second blast the door was not courteously opened, my lord cried out majestically, "Give fire, gunner," and a sturdy smith burst the panels open with a huge sledgehammer. The horrified Lord Mayor being appealed to, soon arrived, attended by ihe watch of the ward and men armed with halberds. At eleven o'clock on the Sunday night the two monarchs came into collision in Hare alley (now Hare-court) The Lord of Misrule bade my Lord Mayor come to him, but Palmer, omitting to take off his hat, the halberds flew sharply round him, his subjects were soundly beaten, and he was dragged off to the Compter. There, with soiled finery, the new year's King was kept two days in durance, the attorney-general at last fetching the fallen monarch away in his own coach. At a court masque soon afterwards King Charles made the two rival potenta.es join nands ; but the King of Misrule had, nevertheless, to refund ail the five shillings, he had exacted, and repair all the Fieet-street doors his too handy gunner had destrored.

Morning Post - Wednesday 28 December 1831
POLICE INTELLIGENCE Bow-Street.— The *Lord of Misrule*, aided by the powerful influence of *Sir John Barleycorn*, exerted his powers with more than ordinary alacrity on Monday night in the district of this office; the consequence was that a list of night charge, exceeding in number the usual catalogue of black eyes, cut heads, &c. usually exhibited on a " Saint Monday," was yesterday morning produced before Mr. Minshlll, the Sitting Magistrate, and occupied the time of his Worship during the entire morning. Amongst the number charged were three young gentlemen holding Government situations, named French, Morgan, and Wentworth. It appeared that as they were reeling home at three o'clock in the morning along the Strand, shouting and singing, they came in contact with two policemen, who requested them to " cease their funning." The sprigs of gentility taking umbrage at this interference on the part of " the blue devils" commenced a furious attack upon them, and the constables being obliged, in self-defence, to use their truncheons, Mr. Theopbilus Morgan releived the weight of one of them on his dexter cheek, which completely spoiled its beauty and painted his cambric frill a deep crimson. The Defendants were subsequently secured, after a desperate resistance, and having inflicted sundry wounds and bruises on their adversaries.

The Defendants pleaded " Christmas times," but Mr. Minshull would not admit the plea, and they were each ordered to pay 40s. to the King as a small atonement to his Majesty for having broken his peace.

The other charges were of the usual description, the parties accused coming in general under the description of drunken tailors shoemakers, &c. In most cases small fines were inflicted proportioned to the nature of the several offences.

London Evening Standard - Tuesday 24 December 1895
STRANGE CHRISTMAS REVELS. " As much conducing to the making of gentlemen more fit for their books at other times." Such was the wording of a remonstrance directed against the under barristers of Lincoln's Inn, in the good old days so called, for that they had not danced before the judge on Candlemas according to an ancient custom. It is a pathetic reminder. and likely enough an honest, at the adage "All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy " be taken as the truth. Yet, when one learns the kind of revels of which this dancing was a part, one feels disposed to think the books would be a sorry exchange for wild merriment, and many weeks be needed in which to climb down to a mundane state from one so extraodinarily elevated. The mode of procedure at that time—that is to say, before the sweeping away of all such customs in front of the broom of the Commonwealth—was the appointment of Christmas Princes or Lords of Misrule, whose function it was to invent and carry out all manner of pranks to make the season merry. These masters of ceremonies were the luxury of the Royal Family, the wealthy lords of the land, the Inns of Court, the Lord Mayor of London, the Universities, and such important personages and institutions. Their equivalents in other countries were in Ssotland the Abbot of Unreason, in France the Pope of Fools, and in Poland the Republic of Baboonery.

The office of a Lord of Misrule was "to make rarest pastime to delight the beholder his length of tenure from the eve of All Hallows to Candlemas Day. He was an educated man ; was allowed his court of subordinates and money to a very extravagant extent. His object was to provide riotous amusement for himself and his patron and his guests, with much intermingling of mischief, disregardful of all reason and every restraint. The Royal honour of knighthood was conferred by Charles I. upon a Christmas Prince of marked renown, who, in addition to the moneys bestowed upon him by his patron for his term of office, spent two thousand pounds during his reign out of his own pocket for the provision of suitable revels. In an ancient quarto, dated 1594, called the "Gesta Grayorum, particulars of the reign of a Christmas Prince of Staple's and Bernard's Inn are given. The lofty sounding titles of this Lord of Misrule were as follows:— The High and Mighty Prince Henry, Prince of Purpoole, Archduke of Stapulia and Bernardia, Duke of High and Nether Holborn, Marquess of St. Giles and Tottenham, Count Palatine of Bloomsbury and Clerkenwell, Great Lord of the Cantons of Islington, Kentish Town, &c. Knight and Sovereign of the most heroical Order of the Helmet. To his mock knights were given such titles as "Sir Randall Rackabite of Rascal Hall, in the county of Rakehell : Sir Francis Flatterer, of Fowlshurst : Sir Morgan Mumchance. of Much Mockery, in the Parish of Mad Mopery," and others as dignified in sound and hollow in meaning. On Christmas Day these functionaries, with many others, including a mock Judge, a High Constable, a Lieutenant of the Tower, a Master Marshal, and a Ranger of the Forest, assembled at the inn and enjoyed a magnificent banquet, after which, headed by the Lord of Misrule, whose power, it was quaintly remarked, was "more potent by night", they enjoyed the revels for which he was responsible. These very naturally included a mock trial, in which the Constable Marshal was accused "of suffering great disorders to prevail." to which the Common Serjeant would reply, and would be opposed by the King's Serjeant. the sentence being the committal to a temporary prison, called the Tower, to the one who lost the case through indifferent oratory. Whereupon a rank outrage upon the bearing of punishment with becoming meekness was allowed, in that if the prisoner could contrive to escape and to bring from the buttery into the hall a manchet or small loaf of bread, as proof that he had been there, he was permitted to go a free man. Another prank was less humane. A cat or a fox, if such could be found, was let loose in the hall, then hunted with a couple of dogs. Killing in front of the great fire formed the end of this revel.

The death blow of the Christmas Prince was, as has before been said, dealt by the Commonwealth. But the way was paved by an unseemly piece of conduct by one Mr. Palmer, Lord of Misrule to the Templars for the season of 1627-28. This Mr. Palmer made an unlawf use of his power in that he commanded his officers to collect certain rents that were due to him in Fleet-street and the neighbourhood, if not by fair means then by foul. Foul were the means, so foul that the Prince of Christmas was arrested, and by the Lord Mayor's sentence was imprisoned for two nights in the common lockup, at which juncture the King stepped in, and peace was restored. But since they had thus been swamped in disgrace by their Lord of Misrule. whose ideas were indeed too practical for them, the Tempters determined no more to appoint such a I:hristmas officer, and the fiat went forth that " for the prevention of that general scandal and obloquie which the House hath heretofore incurred in time of Christmas, there be not any going abroad out of the gates of the House, by any lord or others, to break open any House, or take anything in the name of a rent or a distress." What was done for England Cromwell was done for Scotland by the Restoration, which put an end to the Monastic Prince, the abbot of Unreason. Charles II. was unattended by a "grand Capitaine of mischiefe" when came to the throne, and never since have such revels as he and his like conducted been permitted or encouraged. It is the fashion nowadays to decry Christmas. We have gone to just the opposite extreme of our forefathers. We declare that we shall be glad when Christmas is over; that it is the most miserable time of all the year; that the adjective merry should be changed for melancholy. Is this state of feeling to be accounted for by the assumption that, as a people of habit, we cannot become accustomed to Christmases without mummery ? It may be just an example of heredity after all. Our earliest ancestors were addicted to pretence at Yule. Even we read of the ancient Romans in their Saturnalia masquerading in all kinds of ways—men dressed as women, women as men, and so forth. It was the custom of the early Christians to go about disguised, making fun of Pagan rites and ceremonies. Some of us who are alive now can recollect, lingering in out-of-the-way country places, Christmas plays acted by mummers from house to house, with strange characters, such as the Leech. the Turkish Knight, and St. George, and stranger words —indeed, all but gibberish—handed down from generation to generation, and garbled in the handing. It would seem, indeed, that at Christmas we needed a stirring up. Our climate is not cheerful about the end of December. All the masquerading and mumming and merrymaking that the men and women of older days indulged in at any rite kept them warm, and induced them when their blood ran warmly to look upon life through a rosy veil. Their food, too, was invigorating. The "learned mixture" they celled Christmas pie, made of neat's tongues, chicken, sugar, lemons, and various kinds of spicery; the wassail bowl of old ale sugared, with apples floating atop: the plum porridge served hot like the modern plum pudding, but half fluid in its consistency—all these essentially Yuletide dainties sound as if they ought to have cheered the hearts of their eaters. The question that naturally arises after the pondering of these matters is, do we retain the jollity of Christmas as a holiday, although these ancient inducements have been stamped out ? Or have we missed the happy mean, and are in a fair way to make the season the melancholy one pessimists declare they find it ? The answer obviously is this, that we are our own masters, and can treat the festival as we will. No law binds us to merriment, though an unwritten one may to goodwill. Indeed, it is very happily this universal understanding of the message of Christmas that, in many instances, makes the season the time of generosity and friendliness and care for others that it is. Men outgrow their childish enthusiasm for Christmas stockings and Christmas trees very often, but they do not forget that others revel still in manifestations of the kind at Christmas tide.
