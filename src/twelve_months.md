"PRETTY MARUSCHKA. A Sclavonic tale. It is properly Slovakian, and is given by Wenzig in his * West Slawischer Marchenschatz,' 1857. The story has a mythological importance, on account of the impersonation of the Twelve Months re- presented as seated round the great central fire of the sun. The fire-wheel occurs in traditional usage, not only in Sclavonic but also in Gaulish lands.

Favorite fairy tales retold; the first of a series of children's classics especially adapted for story-telling
"Changes in the original stories have been freely made when necessary to bring them into conformity with the above conditions, for these old folk and fairy tales belong to all peoples and all times; and, as in the olden days, so now, the stamp of the individual story teller may be renewedly impressed upon them.
It is hoped that the stories may prove a source of true joy to the children who read, as well as to story tellers and listeners."
