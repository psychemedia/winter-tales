# Cursed Dancers of Colbek  

I came to this story whilst searching for notes on another tale, the dancing plague, or dancing fever, of Strasbourg, in 1418, after being reminded of it by a song from the Cornish gypsy folk (|?!) band, *3 Daft Monkeys*: [Days of the Dance](https://www.3daftmonkeys.co.uk/days-of-the-dance).

> *Days of the Dance* tells the interesting and mystical story of the dancing plague that took place in Strasbourg in 1518. A woman stepped out on to the street and couldn’t stop dancing. Several days later over 100 people had joined her. They danced for days and days to the sound of professional musicians who were called in to get them to continue dancing. The authorities believed the only cure was to let them dance it off.

THE DANCING MANIA.

It is a well-known fact that diseases wear out, not only in individuals, but in nations; the leprosy and the sweating sickness live only in the pages of history, or at any rate, are no longer to be seen in Europe; and St. Vitus's dance, a troublesome, but rarely a formidable disease, is the meagre remnant of an epidemic which once afflicted thousands, and spread terror and confusion over large districts. This singular change, this mitigation of the disease from a rabid dance to a mere convulsion or distortion of a few muscles, was, we believe, first distinctly narrated and commented on by Dr. Hecker of Berlin.

It was in the year 1374 that assemblages of men and women were seen at Aix-la-Chapelle, who had come out of Germany, and yielded to the uneasiness which oppressed them in the following manner. They formed circles, hand in hand, and continued dancing in the streets for hours together, in a wild delirium, till they fell from sheer exhaustion. They were then in a state of extreme oppression from the tympany which followed these spasmodic ravings; and of this they were relieved by having cloths bound tightly round their waists, or, more simply still, by thumping and trampling on the parts affected. "While dancing they neither saw nor heard, being insensible to external impressions through the senses, but were haunted by visions, their fancies conjuring up spirits whose names they shrieked out; and some of them afterwards asserted, that they felt as if they had been immersed in a stream of blood, which obliged them to leap so high." `[Hecker on 'The Dancing Mania,' translated by Dr. Babington, p.4-5.]`

In the worst cases, the attack began with epileptic convulsions; yet, though the patients fell to the ground senseless, and foamed at the mouth, they were able to spring up and begin the dance amid strange contortions. The disease first appeared at Aix-la-Chapelle in July, and in a few months spread over the Netherlands. In many towns the dancers wore garlands in their hair, and had cloths round their waists, which were tightened as soon as the fit was over, to relieve their uneasiness. Many, however, received more benefit from kicks and blows, which the bystanders were ever ready to administer. These morbid pranks were universally attributed to demoniacal possession, and intimidated the people to such a degree, that by express ordinance none but square-toed shoes were to be made, the dancers having manifested a strong dislike to the pointed shoes which had come into fashion in 1350, immediately after the great plague. They were extremely irritated at the sight of red colours, and some of them could not bear to see persons weeping. Whether from the exorcisms of the clergy, or from mere exhaustion, this particular epidemic soon died out, and in ten or eleven months the St. John's dancers, as they were called, were no longer to be seen in any of the cities of Belgium. This first set of dancers appeared in Aix-la-Chapelle with St. John's name in their mouths, and it is sufficiently probable that the revels of St. John's day, 1374, gave rise to the disease. The people, says Dr. Hecker, were suffering from wretchedness and want, and the frantic celebration of the festival, then observed with great form, was sufficient to kindle the malady in constitutions already prepared for it. In the language of medicine, starvation was the predisposing cause, and the gaiety of the festival the exciting one. The bowels, debilitated by hunger and bad food, were naturally attacked by tympanitis, which will account for the relief obtained by bandaging.

At a later period, in 1418, namely, Strasburg was visited by the dancing plague, and here the aid of St. Vitus was invoked for the cure of the patients. St. Vitus was a Sicilian youth who suffered martyrdom with Modestus and Crescentia, under Dioclesian, in the year 303. His fame gradually increased with the progress of time; and at the beginning of the fifteenth century, or perhaps in the fourteenth, the legend came forth that he could and would protect from the dancing mania all who should solemnize the day of his commemoration, and fast upon its eve.

The Strasburg patients were conducted to the chapels of St. Vitus, near Zabern and Rotestein, and, after hearing mass, were led in solemn procession to the altar. It is probable that many were cured there; at all events, they did not dance before the altars of the saint. Burton, in his 'Anatomy of Melancholy,' tells the chief facts very pleasantly; he says of St. Vitus's dance, "It is so called for that the parties so troubled were wont to go to St. Vitus for help; and after they had danced there awhile, they were certainly freed. 'Tis strange to hear how long they will dance, and in what manner, over stools, forms, tables; even great-bellied women sometimes (and yet never hurt their children) will dance so long that they can stir neither hand nor foot, but seem to be quite dead. One in red clothes they cannot abide. Music above all things they love; and therefore magistrates in Germany will hire musicians to play to them, and some lusty, sturdy companions to dance with them. This disease hath been very common in Germany, as appears by those relations of Schenkius, and Paracelsus, in his book of madness, who brags how many several persons he hath cured of it. Felix Platerus (*De Mentis Alienat.*, cap. iii.) reports of a woman in Basle whom he saw, that danced a whole month together, The Arabians call it a kind of *palsy*." There are some curious lines in J. of Königshoven, the oldest German chronicler in existence, describing the epidemic as it appeared at Strasburg:

'Viel hundert fingen zu Strassburg an,' &c.

which might be translated -

At Strasburg hundreds of folks began  
To dance and leap, both maid and man;  
In open market, lane, and street,  
They skipped along, nor cared to eat,  
Until their plague had ceased to fright us:  
"Twas called the dance of holy Vitus.

These dancing plagues, however, are by no means the most ancient recorded in history. In 1237 more than a hundred children were seized with this disease, at Erfurt, and went dancing and jumping along the road to Arnstadt. Here they fell exhausted to the ground; many of them died, and the rest were afflicted with a permanent trembling for the rest of their lives. In 1278, two hundred fanatics began to dance upon the bridge over the Moselle at Utrecht, and would not desist till a priest passed, who was carrying the Host to a sick person, on which the bridge gave way and they were all drowned. Nay, as early as 1027, a similar event occurred near the convent church of Kolbig.

Eighteen peasants are said to have disturbed divine service on Christmas-eve, by dancing and brawling in the churchyard; on which the priest, Ruprecht, cursed them to the effect that they should dance and scream for a whole year without ceasing. This curse was fulfilled, says the legend, so that the sufferers at length sank knee-deep into earth, and remained without nourishment till they were released by the intercession of two pious bishops. Upon this they fell into a deep sleep, which lasted three days; four of them died, and the rest continued to suffer all their lives from a trembling of their limbs.

Whatever fragment of truth there may have been in this story, it was firmly believed during the middle ages, and with the succeeding plagues of a like kind so impressed the minds of the people, that St. Vitus's dance formed the basis of a heavy maledictia: *Dass Dich Sanct Veitstanz ankomme*, i.e. may you be seized with St. Vitus's dance. It was not till the beginning of the sixteenth century that St. Vitus's dance lost its unhallowed character, as the work of demons, and became the subject of medical inquiry. This was due to that great and eccentric genius Paracelsus, who explained the communication of the disease by sympathy with considerable ingenuity, and recommended a curious remedy for the variety which depended on the imagination. "The patient was to make an image of himself in wax or rosin, and by an effort of thought to concentrate all his blasphemies and sins in it. 'Without the iniervention of any other person, to set his whole minds and thoughts concerning these oaths in the image;' and when he succeeded in this, he was to burn the image, so that not a particle of it should remaim." `[Hecker on 'The Dancing Mania,' translated by Dr. Babington, p. 33.]`

This imaginative method of curing a distemper dependent on the imagination, appears to be copied, as Dr. Babington observes, from a classic mode of enchantment. The sorceress made a wax image of the person to be tormented; and by sticking pins into the figure, or melting it before the fire, she hoped to inflict similar ills on the-prototype. Thus Simoetha says, in Theocritus:

> "Just as I melt this wax before the fire,  
> So may young Delphis waste with slow desire." —Anon.

Nor did this strange fancy expire with the superstition of the ancients, for it is to be found in the works on magic written in the middle ages. About this time the dancing mania began to decline, so that the severer cases of St. Vitus's became rarer, and in modern times have totally disappeared. Schenck von Graffenberg, a celebrated physician, who died in 1598, speaks of the disease as having been common only in the time of his forefathers. In the beginning of the next century it was only occasionally observed im its ancient form. Thus in 1623 G. Horst saw some women who annually performed a pilgrimage to St. Vitus's chapel at Drefelhausen, near Weissenstein, in the territory of Ulm. There they waited till the dancing-fit came on, continuing day and night in a state of delirium, till they fell to the ground; and when they recovered from this state, they felt relieved of the uneasiness and sensation of weight, of which they had complained for weeks previously. Music seems in some measure to have excited the paroxysms of St. Vitus's dance, though by its continuance it soothed the violence of the convulsions.

The Thirty Years' War, which lasted from 1618 to 1648, finally extinguished this singular form of disease; for though the calamities it brought upon Germany were unspeakable, yet, with the vehemence of a purifying fire, they gradually effected the intellectual regeneration of the Germans, and thus put a stop to a malady excited by superstition. Dr. Hecker's account of tarantism, which may be called the dancing plague of Italy, and other convulsive epidemics, we will reserve for a future occasion.

## The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck

The article in the *Penny Post*, based on the chapter *"The Dancing Mania"* in Babington's 1844 edition of the Hecker's *Epidemics of the Middle Ages*, identifies two major outbreaks of the sickness, in Strasbourg in 1418 and Aix-la-Chappelle in 1374, along with a couple of others, but dates another notable outbreak back even earlier, to 1027, in *Kolbig* (and variously Kölbigk, Cölbigk, Colbeck, etc.).

> Eighteen peasants are said to have disturbed divine service on Christmas-eve, by dancing and brawling in the churchyard; on which the priest, Ruprecht, cursed them to the effect that they should dance and scream for a whole year without ceasing

What a fabulous hint of a tale. That is far too good a suggestion of a story for there not to be other elaborations of it.

If William of Malmesbury is to be believed, the original tale of the dancing curse, which Hecker dates to 1027, *"near the convent church of Kolbig"*, must be a true one, because he provides a statement of an account of the whole episode from one of the carollers who had been so cursed. He dates it to the year 1012, giving the location as *"a certain town of Saxony"*.

```{admonition} "I, Ethelbert, a sinner", 1847

In William of Malmesbury's *Chronicle of the kings of England: from the earliest period to the reign of King Stephen*, 1847, [pp.181-3](https://archive.org/details/williamofmalmesb47will/page/182/mode/2up).

And since I have wandered from my subject, I think it may not be unpleasant to relate what took place in Saxony in the time of this king, in the year of our Lord 1012, and is not so generally known. It is better to dilate on such matters than to dwell on Ethelred's indolence and calamities: and it will be more pleasing certainly, and nearer the truth, if I subjoin it in the original language of the person who was a sufferer, than if I had clothed it in my own words. Besides, I think it ornamental to a work, that the style should be occasionally varied.

"I Ethelbert, `[Other MSS. read Otbert.]` a sinner, even were I desirous of concealing the divine judgment which overtook me, yet the tremor of my limbs would betray me; wherefore I shall relate circumstantially how this happened, that all may know the heavy punishment due to disobedience. We were, on the eve of our Lord's nativity, in a certain town of Saxony, in which was the church of Magnus the martyr, and a priest named Robert had begun the first mass. I was in the churchyard with eighteen companions, fifteen men and three women, dancing, and singing profane songs to such a degree that I interrupted the priest, and our voices resounded amid the sacred solemnity of the mass. Wherefore, having commanded us to be silent, and not being attended to, he cursed us in the following words, 'May it please God and St. Magnus, that you may remain singing in that manner for a whole year.' His words had their effect. The son of John the priest seized his sister who was singing with us, by the arm, and immediately tore it from her body; but not a drop of blood flowed out. She also remained a whole year with us, dancing and singing. The rain fell not upon us; nor did cold, nor heat, nor hunger, nor thirst, nor fatigue assail us: we neither wore our clothes nor shoes, but we kept on singing as though we had been insane. First we sank into the ground up to our knees: next to our thighs; a covering was at length, by the permission of God, built over us to keep off the rain. When a year had elapsed, Herbert, bishop of the city of Cologne, released us from the tie wherewith our hands were bound, and reconciled us before the altar of St. Magnus. The daughter of the priest, with the other two women, died immediately; the rest of us slept three whole days and nights: some died afterwards, and are famed for miracles: the remainder betray their punishment by the trembling of their limbs. This narrative was given to us by the lord Peregrine, the successor of Herbert, in the year of our Lord 1013."

The Penny Post's description of the events quotes Robert Burton's, *The anatomy of melancholy: what it is, with all the kindes, causes, symptomes, prognostickes, and severall cures of it: in three maine partitions with their seuerall sections, members, and subsections: philosophically, medicinally, historically, opened and cut up*, 1621, [part.x. Sec. 1. 1. Diſeases of the Minde](https://archive.org/details/anatomyofmelanch00burt_2), so perhaps there is more to be told there? A quick check of the reference shows that the quote is a complete one, so for more detail we must look elsewhere.

In the richly annotated contents of Furnivall's edited version of Robert Mannyng's *Handlyng Synne*, we do find a more elaborate synopsis of the tale.

The Tale of the Sacrilegious Carollers:— How they danced together for Twelve Months without Stopping, and then hopped separately ever afterwards ..... 280-286

One Christmas night twelve fools got up a carol, and came to the town of Colbeck, to the church of St. Magne and St. Bukcestre; their leader was Bevo, and their poet Gerlew, and Merswynde and Wybessyne were two of the maidens. These girls go in and fetch out Ave, the daughter of the priest Robert, and they carol away in the churchyard. They disturb the priest at mass, and he bids them cease, but they will not; on which he prays God and St. Magne that they may be made to dance on for a twelvemonth for, as the Latin says, for ever. At once their hands are locked together, and cannot be parted for a year. The priest sends his son Agone to bring in Ave, and he does take hold of her arm, but it comes off, and the body goes on dancing, and neither it nor the arm bleeds. Agone takes the arm to his father, who is full of woe, and buries it; but next day it is out of the grave again, and this is repeated twice; so the arm is laid on the altar.

The carollers dance on, feeling no cold, or heat, or rain, knowing nothing of night or day. What living man could help coming to see the marvel? The Emperor Henry came from Rome, and told carpenters to make a covering over them; but what was put up one day, 'on the tother, down it lay,' and so the attempt was given up. At the twel'month's end, at the same hour in which the priest cursed them, the carollers flew apart, and into the church, and lay three days as dead. Then all revive but Ave. whose father dies too, and her arm is put in a vessel and hung in the church.

The carollers go on hopping separately, never together; four went 'with sundry leaps' to the Court of Rome, and were 'ever hopping about,' and got no relief except at the tomb of St. Edith.

'This tale so marvellous' is told by Bp. Brunyng of St. Tolouse, afterwards Pope Leo; and it is written in Chronicles beyond the sea more than it is here, — as men well say, 'The nearer the church, the further from God,' 1. 9236-43. Some men 'hold it but a troteuale' (gammon), others as a great marvel; it certainly is a fair example against cursing, and against carolling in churchyards against the priest's will, 1. 9244-53.

The prose synopsis gives us a good basis for a telling, but is there more to find in the more complete metrical verse version? Furnivall provides versions of the tale in Middle English metrical verse ([pp. 279-86](https://archive.org/details/HandlyngSynneFurnivall1862/page/n375/mode/2up)).

Reading the Middle English is perhaps something of an acquired tast, so we can cast it into an intermediate form by updating some of the spelling and simple grammar, before then attempting to engage in a more contemprary translation.

Carolles, wrastlynges, or somore games—  
Whoso evere haunteth any such shames

Of sacrilege he may be afeard;  
Or entreludës or syngyng,  
Or tabour bete or other pipynge—  
Alle suche thyng forboden is  
While the preest stondeth at messe.  
Alle suche to every good preest is loth,  
And sooner wyl he make him wroth  
Thanne he wyl that hath no wyt  
Ne understondeth not Holy Writ;  
And specially at heighe tymes

Nought in none holy steads  
That myghte destourbe the prestes bedes,  
Or if he were in orisoun  
Or any other devocioun:  
Sacrilege is al it tolde,  
This and many other folde.
But for-to leve in churche to daunce,  
I shal you telle a ful greete chaunce,  
And I trow, the moste that fel

*The Tale of the Sacrilegious carolers, and how they danced together for twelve Months without stopping, and then went hopping about singly ever afterwards.*

It was upon a Christemesse nyght  
That twelve fools a carole dighte,  
In woodhede, as it were in contest;  
They come to a toun men called Colbek.  
The churche of the toun that they to come  
Is of Seint Magne that suffred martyrdom;  
Of Seint Bukcestre it is also,  
Seint Magnes suster, that they come to.  
Her names of alle thus fond I write,  
And as I wot now shullen ye wite:  
Her lodes-man that made hem glew,  
Thus is write, he highte Gerlew;  
`[The other twelve, here named al, Thus were they wrote as I can call]`
Two maydens were in here coveyne,  
Maiden Merswynde and Wybessyne.  
Alle thise come thider for that enchesoun,  
Of the prestes doghter of the toun.
The preest highte Robert, as I can ame;  
Azone highte his sone by name;  
His doghter, that thise `men` wulde have,  
Thus is write, that she highte Ave.  
Ech on consented to own wylle  
Who sholde go Ave out to tille.  
They graunted ech oon out to sende  
Bothe Wibessyne and Merswynde.  
Thise wommen yede and tollede hire oute  
With hem to carole the churche aboute.  
Bevune ordeyned here carolyng.  
Gerlew endited what they sholde sing.  
This is the carole that they shuld syng,  
As telleth the Latyn tonge:  
*"Equitabat Beuo per siluam frondosam,*  
*Ducebat secum Merswyndam formosam.*  
*Quid stamus? Cur non imus?"*

"By the leved wode rode Bevolyne,  
With him he ledde fair Merswyne.  
Why stonde we? why gon we nought?"  
This is the carole that Grysly wroghte.  
This song sunge they in the churche-yerd—  
Of folye were they nothing afeerd—  
Un to the matynes were alle done,  
And the messe shuld bigynne soone.  
The preest him revest to begynne messe,  
And they ne left ther-fore nevere the lesse,  
But daunsed forth as they bygan—; 
For all the messe they ne blan.  
The preest, that stood at the autere  
And herde her noise and her bere,  
From the autere doun he nam  
And to the churche porche he cam,  
And seyde: "On Goddes behalf, I you forbidde  
That ye no lenger don such dede;  
But cometh in on faire manere  
Goddes servise for to here,  
And doth at Cristen mannes lawe,  
Caroleth no more, for Cristes awe.  
Worshipeth Him with al youre myght  
That of the virgine was born this nyght."  
For alle his bidding lefte they noght,  
But daunsede forth as they thoght.  
The preest therefor was sore agreved;  
He preyed God, that he on bileved,  
And for Seint Magne, that He wulde so werche,  
In whos worship set was the churche  
That such a vengeaunce were on hem sent,  
Are they out of that stede were went,  
That they myghte evere right so wende  
Unto that tyme twelve-month ende.  
In Latyn that I fond thore  
He seyth not twelve-month but evermore.  
He cursed hem there alsame  
As they carolede on here game.

As soone as the preest hadde so spoke  
Every hand in other so faste was loke  
That no man myghte, wyth no wonder,  
That twelve-month parte hem asonder.  
The preest ghede inne whan this was don  
And commaunded his sone Azone  
That he sholde go swithe after Ave,  
Out of that carole algate to have.  
But al to late that word was seyd,  
For on hem alle was the vengeaunce leyd.  
Azone wende wel for to spede;  
Unto the carole as-swithe he yede.  
His syster by the arm he hente,  
And the arm from the body wente.  
Men wundrede alle that there wore,  
And merveil mowe ye here more;  
For sithen he hadde the arm in hande,  
The body yede furth carolande;  
And neither the body, ne the arm  
Bledde never bloode, cold ne warm,  
But was as drye with al the haunche,  
As of a stok were riven a braunche.  
Azone to his fader went  
And brought him a sory present:  
"Loke, Fader," he seyde, "and have it heer,  
The arm of thy doghter dere,  
That was myn owne syster Ave,  
That I wende I myghte have save.  
Thy cursing now sene it es  
With vengeaunce on thy owne flessh.  
Fellyche thou cursedest, and over-soon;  
Thou askedest vengeaunce, thou hast thy boon."  
You thar nat aske if there was wo  
Wyth the preest and with many mo.  
The preest that cursed for that daunce,  
On some of his, fel harde chaunce.  
He took his doghtres arm forlorn  
And buryed it on the morn.  
The nexte day the arm of Ave  
He fond it liggyng above the grave.  
He buryed it on another day,  
And eft above the grave it lay.  
The thridde tyme he buryed it,  
And eft was it cast out of the pit.  
The preest wolde burye it no more:  
He dredde the vengeaunce ferly sore.  
In to the churche he bare the arme  
For drede and doute of more harme;  
He ordeined it for to be  
That every man myghte with eye it see.  
These men that yede so carolande  
Alle that yere hand in hande,  
They nevere out of that stede yede,  
Ne none myghte hem thenne lede.  
Ther the cursyng first bigan,  
In that place aboute they ran,  
That never ne fette they no werynes—  
As many bodies for goyng dos—  
Ne mete ete, ne drank drynke,  
Ne slepte only a lepy wynke.  
Nyght, ne daym they wiste of non,  
Whan it was come, what it was gone,  
Frost ne snow, hayl ne reyne,  
Of colde ne hete, felte they no paine;  
Heer ne nayles nevere grewe,  
Ne solowede clothes, ne turnede hewe;  
Thunder ne lightning dide hit hem no dere—  
Goddes mercy dide hit fro hem were—  
But sunge that song that the wo wroghte:  
"Why stonde we? why go we noght?"
What man shuld ther be in this lyve  
That it ne wolde it see and thider dryve?  
The Emperour Henry come fro Rome  
For to see this harde doom.  
When he hem saw, he wepte sore  
For the mischief that he saw thore.  
He did come wrightes for-to make  
Coveryng over hem, for tempeste sake.  
But that they wroghte, it was in vayn,  
For it cam to no certeyn;  
For that they sette on oo day,  
On the tother, doun it lay.  
Ones, twyes, thries, thus they wroght,  
And al her makyng was for nought.  
Myghte no covering hyle hem from colde  
Til tyme of mercy that Christ hem wolde.  
Tyme of grace fel thurgh His myght  
At the twelvemonth ende, on the Yole night.  
The same houre that the preest hem banned,  
The same houre atwynne they wonede;  
That houre that he cursed hem inne,  
The same houre they yede atwynne;  
And as in a twynkelyng of an eye  
In to the churche gonne they flye,  
And on the pavement they felle alle doun  
As they hadde ben dede, or falle in a swoun.  
Three dayes stille they lay ech on,  
That none stired other fleash or bone,  
And at the three dayes ende  
To lyfe God graunted hem to wende.  
They setre them up and spak apert  
To the parishe preest, Sir Robert  
"Thou art ensample and enchesoun  
Of oure long confusioun;  
Thou maker art of oure travaile,  
That is to many greet merveil;  
And thy travail shalt thou soone ende,  
For to thy long home soone shalt thou wende."  
Alle they rise that yche tide  
But Ave: she lay dede beside.  
Grete sorowe had her fader, her brother;  
Merveil and drede hadde alle other.  
I trowe no drede of soule deed,  
But with pyne was broghte the body dede.  
The firste man was the fader, the preest,  
That deyde after the doghter nest,  
This eche arme that was of Ave,  
That none myghte lay in grave,  
The emperoure dide a vessel werche  
To do it in, and honge in the churche,  
That alle men myghte see it and knowe,  
And thenke on the chaunce whan they it sawe.  
Thise men that hadde gon thus carolande,  
Alle the yere, fast hand in hande,  
Thogh that they were than asunder,  
Yet al the worlde spake of hem wunder.  
That same hoppyng that they first yede,  
That daunce wente they thurgh land and lede;  
And as they ne myghte first be unbounde,  
So efte togedyr myghte they nevere be founde,  
Ne myghte they never come ageyn  
Togedyr to oon stede certeyn.  
Foure yede to the court of Rome  
And ever hoppyng aboute they nome;  
With sunder lepes come they thider,  
But they come never eft togidre.  
Her clothes ne roted, ne nayles grewe,  
Ne heer ne wax, ne solowed hewe,  
Ne never hadde they amendement,  
That we herde, at any corseint,  
But at the virgine Saint Edith,  
There was he botenede Seint Theodoric,  
On Oure Lady Day in Lenten-tide,  
As he slepte her toumbe beside,  
There he hadde his medicine  
At Seint Edith the holy virgìne.  

Brunyng the bisshop of Seint Tolous  
Wrote this tale so merveilous;  
Sethe was his name of more renoun—  
Men callede him the Pope Leoun;  
This at the court of Rome they wite,  
And in the cronicles it is write  
In many stedes the yond the see  
More than is in this countree.  
Therfor men seye, and wel is trowed,  
"The neer the chirche, the further from God."

So fare men heer by this tale,  
Som holde it but a trotevale;  
In othre stedes it is full dere,  
And for greet merveil they will it here.  
A taile it is of faire shewyng,  
Ensample and drede agens cursyng.  
This tale I tolde you to make you afeerd  
In churche to carole, or in chiuche-yeerd,  
Namely agens the prestes wylle:  
Leveth, whan he biddeth you be stille.

```{admonition} The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck (modern English)
:class: dropdown

The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck

Carols, wrestling, or summer games—  
Whoever engages in such pastimes  
In church or in the churchyard,  
Should be wary of committing sacrilege.  
As far as comic plays, or singing,  
Or drumming, or playing the pipes, goes,  
These should all be forbidden  
While the priest is celebrating Mass.  
All such things are loathsome to every good priest,  
And nothing is more likely to anger him  
Than a fool  
Or anyone who doesn't respect the Holy Scripture.  
And this is particularly true for high days and holidays  
When singing songs or reciting rhymes  
Around those holy places  
Might disturb the priest's prayers,  
For when he is praying at such times  
Or engaged in any other devotion:  
Then it is *sacrilege*,  
Wherever it occurs.
Speaking of such dancing around the churchyard:  
Do I have a tale to tell you!  
A tale of events that really happened,  
As true as the Gospel itself.  
It happened,  
As I understand it,  
In the time of King Edward:  
A truly terrible tale.

*The Tale of the Sacrilegious carolers, and how they danced together for twelve Months without stopping, and then went hopping about singly ever afterwards.*

It was Christmas Eve,  
And twelve revellers (as the chronicler describes them) arranged "a carol", which is to say, a bit of a party,  
Just for a bit of fun.  
They decided to take a trip to the town of Colbek.  
The Church there was dedicated to St Magne,  
Who suffered martyrdom,  
And also St Bukcestre,  
St Magnes' sister.
I'll mention the revellers' names as I was told them,  
And as I know them, now you shall know them:
The leader of the revellers,  
Or so it was written, was a man named Gerle.  
There were also two young women in the group,  
Mersynde and Wybessyne.  
And the reason they came to Colbek, and to that Church in particular?  
Well, that would be the priest's daughter.
The priest was named Robert, if I remember correctly;  
And his son was named Azone;  
And his daughter — the one whom the partygoers had came to meet —  
She was apparently called Ave.  
Between them,  
They agreed  
Who should try to entice Ave out:  
Wybessyne and Merwynde.
The young women approached Ave, and persuaded her
To join their party.  
Bevune led the dance  
And Gerlew suggested what they should sing.  
It was this,  
In the original Latin:  
*"Equitabat Beuo per siluam frondosam,*  
*Ducebat secum Merswyndam formosam.*  
*Quid stamus? Cur non imus?"*

The gist of it was this:  
*"By the leafy wood rode Bevolyne*  
*And with him the fair Merswyne.*  
*Why should we stay? Why shouldn't we go?*  
Or something like that,  
And that was the song that Grysly composed.  
They sang it in the graveyard  
With no regard for anyone else,  
Even while the prayers were being said,  
Even as the Mass was about to begin.
The priest was starting to put on his vestments, ready to start the Mass,
But that didn't stop them,  
And they continued dancing, just as they'd started,  
And didn't stop throug the whole of the Mass.
The priest, who doing his best at the altar,  
Couldn't help but hear their commotion  
And so he came down from the altar  
And went to the Church porch  
And said: "In God's name,  
Will you please just stop that?  
You're most welcome to come in,  
And join our service.
But please, do show some respect,  
And just stop your dancing for now,  
As we worship the birth of Christ, our Lord,  
Who was born of the Holy Virgin Mary on this sacred night."
But for all at, they didn't stop,
They just carried on with their singing and dancing.  
And quite understandably, the priest was sorely aggrieved.  
So he prayed to God, in whom he believed,  
And to Saint Magne,
In whose name the Church was dedicated,  
That He should act—  
To wreak vengeance on the dancers  
Before they left  
And force them to keep dancing  
Until a year had passed.
(Actually, in the original Latin text  
It says "for evermore".)  
Anyway, he cursed them all something like that.  
As they danced around him.

And as soon as he had finished speaking,  
The dancers found they couldn't let go of each others' hands
[And they asked each other:  
What did he say? What was that curse he said?]
The priest went back inside  
And told he son Azone  
To go and bring Ave back  
By whatever means necessary.  
But it was too late:  
*All* the dancers had been cursed.

Azone quickly set off  
To try and retrieve his sister.  
He grabbed her by the arm,  
But it came off in his hands. Quite literally. He ripped it off.  
Everyone stared  
And gasped, in shock.  
Because even though Azone had his sister's arm in his hand,  
She just continued dancing.  
There was no blood anywhere  
Not from her shoulder, nor from the arm itself
A clean break,  
Like a branch snapped off from a tree.

Azone rushed back to his father  
His sister's arm still in his hand  
"Father... I...  
"This arm...
"It's Ave's...
"I didn't mean to, I was just trying ot get her to come back...  
"But the curse you summoned  
"Fell on your own flesh and blood...
"That curse was a terrible one.
"You asked for vengeance, and you've got it."

You might well ask how the priest responded,  
How his congregation felt too:
That their priest, who'd called for the dancing to continue,  
Should see one of his own cursed the same way too.

He sadly took his daughter's arm  
And buried it the next morning.
But the day after that,  
He found it lying on the ground on top of the grave.
He buried it again,  
But once again, the *next* day, there it was: on top of the grave.  
The third time he buried it,  
The same thing happened again.  
There was no reason to believe that he would have any more success if he tried again  
And he severely regretted the curse he had made,  
So he carried the arm into the Church,  
Fearful of what might happen if he left it outside,  
And placed it where everyone could see it  
With their own eyes. As a lesson.

As to the rest of the carollers — the dancers — they carried on dancing  
For the whole of the year, hand in hand,  
And just couldn't get away from there  
No matter how hard they tried.  
The curse that was made there  
Would be spent there.  
And it was as if they never got tired  
Though you might expect them to, what with the continous dancing,  
And they never ate; and they never drank
And they didn't even sleep, not a single wink.  
Whether it was day or night  
Whatever the weather  
Frost or snow, hail or rain,  
Warm or cold, they seemed oblivious to it.  
Their hair never grew, their nails never grew  
Their clothes never seemed to change, never seemed to need washing, didn't fade in the sunlight.  
And when the storm clouds thundered, and the lightning struck around them, it did them no harm,  
As if God's mercy was somehow *protecting* them.  
And so they sang:
"Why are stuck here? Why can't we let go?"  
And who in their right mind  
Wouldn't want to go and see such a spectacle?  
The Emperor himself came from Rome  
To see the dancers' fate.  
And when he saw them, he cried in sympathy  
At the misfortune he saw there.  
He summoned some carpenteers
To make a shelter to protect them from the rain  
But it was a pointless task  
That came to nothing,  
Because whatever they managed to build during one day  
Was razed to the ground by the next.
Once, twice, three times they tried  
But all their efforts came to nothing.  
It seemed like no covering could protect the dancers  
Unless Christ, in his might, would grant them mercy.  
At the end of the year, on the next Christmas night,  
At the same time that the priest had proclaimed against them them the previous year,  
At the exact same hour  
A year later, from when he had first cursed them,  
The dancers managed to let go of each others' hands,  
And, in the twinkling of an eye  
Ran into the Church  
And fell to the floor  
As if they had fainted, or fallen into a swoon.
For three days they lay there, each and every one,  
Not moving a muscle.  
But then, after three days,  
It was as if God had raised them up again  
And they sat up, and each of them spoke  
To the parish priest, to Sir Robert:  
"You were the one who caused  
The confusion that afflicted us over the past year,
You caused our troubles,  
That everyone came to gawp at.  
But your own earthly troubles will soon come to an end,  
Because you'll return to your eternal home soon enough."
At this point, they all stood up  
Except for Ave, who still lay dead.  
And her Father, and her brother, grieved sorely for her  
While everyone else gasped.  
I don't believe his soul was damned  
But I do think that the physical suffering that caused his death
Was caused by his grief at the loss of his daughter,  
Becuase the priest died the very next day.  
But what of Ave's arm?  
The arm that couldn't be buried?  
The emperor had a casket made,  
Into which the arm was placed, and hung it  
So that all might see it, and know  
And ponder what lesson they might learn from it.
And what of the revellers who,  
Throughout that year, had been locked hand in hand?  
Even though they'd now been separated,  
Everyone still gawped at them  
Because that same hopping dance that they had first done,  
Hadn't stopped, and they carried on dancing still.  
But whereas they hadn't been able to separate themselves from each other before,  
Now they couldn't stand (in many senses of the word) to remain  
In the same place  
At the same time, together.

Four went to *(the court of)* Rome,  
Dancing and hopping their whole way there  
Individually making their way, with leaps and bounds,  
Though they never crossed paths with each other again.  
Their clothes never needed washing, never faded,  
Their hair and their nails never grew  
And they never found a cure  
Anywhere, not at any any shrine,  
Except for one: at the shrine of St Edith,  
Where Saint Theodoric was given a cure
On Our Lady's Day, in Lenten time.  
As he slept beside her tomb  
He receieved a cure  
From Saint Edith, the holy virgin.

It was Brunnyng, the Bishop of Saint Toulous,  
Who wrote this marvellous tale.  
And afterwards, his name was even more renowned,  
As Pope Leon,  
As they knew him at Rome  
And as it was written in the chronicles,  
And many places beyound the sea
More so than here.  
Therefore men say, and well it is believed,  
"The nearer to *(the)* church, the further from God."  
So pay due regard to the lesson of this tale:  
Some say, it is but an idle story.  
But others believe it as the truth,  
And wonder at it, as a marvel  
A tale that illustrates plainly,  
An example and a dreadful warning, against cursing.  
This tale I told to you, as a warning, against  
Dancing in church, or in the churchyard,  
Especially if the priest tells you not to:  
Just leave quietly when he asks you to be still.

## A Telling

I've been meaning to, but never had, or perhaps, never *made*, or perhaps even never *taken* the opportunuty of telling this tale. But for a set of seasonal Winter Tales at the Carvel Lane Coffee House in Cowes, I stuck it on the flyter of tales I *would* tell at that event, so I've backed myself into a corner where tell it I must.

So here's the initial attempt I made at sketching out a telling of *The Cursed Dancers of Colbeck*.
