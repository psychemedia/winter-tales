And since I have wandered from my subject, I think it may not be unpleasant to relate what took place in Saxony in the time of this king, in the year of our Lord 1012, and is not so generally known. It is better to dilate on such matters than to dwell on Ethelred's indolence and calamities: and it will be more pleasing certainly, and nearer the truth, if I subjoin it in the original language of the person who was a sufferer, than if I had clothed it in my own words. Besides, I think it ornamental to a work, that the style should be occasionally varied.

"I Ethelbert, `[Other MSS. read Otbert.]` a sinner, even were I desirous of concealing the divine judgment which overtook me, yet the tremor of my limbs would betray me; wherefore I shall relate circumstantially how this happened, that all may know the heavy punishment due to disobedience. We were, on the eve of our Lord's nativity, in a certain town of Saxony, in which was the church of Magnus the martyr, and a priest named Robert had begun the first mass. I was in the churchyard with eighteen companions, fifteen men and three women, dancing, and singing profane songs to such a degree that I interrupted the priest, and our voices resounded amid the sacred solemnity of the mass. Wherefore, having commanded us to be silent, and not being attended to, he cursed us in the following words, 'May it please God and St. Magnus, that you may remain singing in that manner for a whole year.' His words had their effect. The son of John the priest seized his sister who was singing with us, by the arm, and immediately tore it from her body; but not a drop of blood flowed out. She also remained a whole year with us, dancing and singing. The rain fell not upon us; nor did cold, nor heat, nor hunger, nor thirst, nor fatigue assail us: we neither wore our clothes nor shoes, but we kept on singing as though we had been insane. First we sank into the ground up to our knees: next to our thighs; a covering was at length, by the permission of God, built over us to keep off the rain. When a year had elapsed, Herbert, bishop of the city of Cologne, released us from the tie wherewith our hands were bound, and reconciled us before the altar of St. Magnus. The daughter of the priest, with the other two women, died immediately; the rest of us slept three whole days and nights: some died afterwards, and are famed for miracles: the remainder betray their punishment by the trembling of their limbs. This narrative was given to us by the lord Peregrine, the successor of Herbert, in the year of our Lord 1013."

Against Carols, Wrestlings, or Summer Games, in Churchyards, ..... 279 Or entyrludes, or syngynge, 8993

Or tabure bete, or oJ>er pypynge,

all this is forbidden during mass-time. And I shall tell you 'a ful grete chaunce' that happened in England in King Edward's time, 1. 9010-16.

The Tale of the Sacrilegious Carollers:— How they danced together for Twelve Months without Stopping, and then hopped separately ever afterwards ..... 280-286

One Christmas night twelve fools got up a carol, and came to the town of Colbeck, to the church of St. Magne and St. Bukcestre; their leader was Bevo, and their poet Gerlew, and Merswynde and Wybessyne were two of the maidens. These girls go in and fetch out Ave, the daughter of the priest Robert, and they carol away in the churchyard. They disturb the priest at mass, and he bids them cease, but they will not; on which he prays God and St. Magne that they may be made to dance on for a twelvemonth for, as the Latin says, for ever. At once their hands are locked together, and cannot be parted for a year. The priest sends his son Agone to bring in Ave, and he does take hold of her arm, but it comes off, and the body goes on dancing, and neither it nor the arm bleeds. Agone takes the arm to his father, who is full of woe, and buries it; but next day it is out of the grave again, and this is repeated twice; so the arm is laid on the altar.

The carollers dance on, feeling no cold, or heat, or rain, knowing nothing of night or day. What living man could help coming to see the marvel? The Emperor Henry came from Rome, and told carpenters to make a covering over them; but what was put up one day, 'on the tother, down it lay,' and so the attempt was given up. At the twel'month's end, at the same hour in which the priest cursed them, the carollers flew apart, and into the church, and lay three days as dead. Then all revive but Ave. whose father dies too, and her arm is put in a vessel and hung in the church.

The carollers go on hopping separately, never together; four went 'with sundry leaps' to the Court of Rome, and were 'ever hopping about,' and got no relief except at the tomb of St. Edith.

'This tale so marvellous' is told by Bp. Brunyng of St. Tolouse, afterwards Pope Leo; and it is written in Chronicles beyond the sea more than it is here, — as men well say, 'The nearer the church, the further from God,' 1. 9236-43. Some men 'hold it but a troteuale ' (gammon), others as a great marvel; it certainly is a fair example against cursing, and against carolling in churchyards against the priest's will, 1. 9244-53.

Jangling is sacrilege. All that we jangle in church the devil writes down on his roll against us, 1. 9254-9.

But I’ll tell you a joke of a holy man, —

The Tale of the Devil's Disappointment with the Jangling (chattering) Women . 287, 288

At a mass-time, while reading the gospel, a deacon laughed out loud. His priest blamed him, and asked why he did it. He answers, 'As I read, two women were jangling, and a devil between them wrote all their words down on his roll till he’d filled it. Then he tried and tugged with his teeth to pull out more parchment; it wouldn't come, but tore, and his head drove against the wall, at which I burst out laughing; and when he perceived that I saw him, he hit the roll with his fist and went away; which was good game.'

Thou Jangler, hold thy tongue in church, and speak to God in thy prayers, 1. 9308-13.

Caroles, wrastlynges, or somore games—  
Whoso evere *haunteth* `[frequents]` any swiche shames  
In chirche *other* `[or]` in chirche-yeerd,  
Of sacrilege he may be aferrde;  
Or *entreludës* `[comic plays, farces]` or syngyng,  
Or *tabour* `[tabor]` bete or other pipynge—  
Alle swiche thyng forboden is  
Whil the preest stondeth at *messe* `[mass]`.  
Alle swiche to every good preest is loth,  
And *sonner* `[sooner]` wyl he make him wroth  
Thanne he wyl that hath no wyt  
Ne understondeth not Holy Writ;  
And specially at heighe tymes  
Caroles to synge, and rede *rymes* `[(trivial) poems]`  
Noght in none holy *stedes* `[places]`  
That myghte destourbe the prestes *bedes* `[prayers]`,  
Or if he were in orisoun  
Or any other devocioun:  
Sacrilege is al it tolde,  
This and many other folde.

But for-to *leve* `[leave off]` in chirche to daunce,  
I shal you telle a ful greete chaunce,  
And I trow, the moste that *fel* `[i.e. befell]`  
Is as sooth as the Gospel:  
And fel this chaunce in this londe,  
In Englond, as I understonde;  
In a kynges tyme that *highte* `[was called]` Edward  
Fel this chaunce that was so hard.

*The Tale of the Sacrilegious carolers, and how they danced together for twelve Months without stopping, and then went hopping about singly ever afterwards.*

It was upon a Christemesse nyght  
That twelve *foles* `[fools]` a carole *dighte* `[arranged]`,  
In *woodhede* `[madness]`, as it were in *contek* `[competition]`;  
They come to a toun men calleth Colbek.  
The chirche of the toun that they to come  
Is of Seint Magne that suffred martyrdom;  
Of Seint Bukcestre it is also,  
Seint Magnes suster, that they come to.  
Her names of alle thus fond I write,  
And as I wot now shullen ye wite:  
Her *lodes-man* `[leader]` that made hem *glew* `[=glee]`,  
Thus is write, he highte Gerlew;  
Two maydens were in here *coveyne* `[band]`,  
Maiden Merswynde and Wybessyne.  
Alle thise come thider *for that enchesoun* `[for that reason, i.e. because]`  
Of the prestes doghter of the toun.  

The preest highte Robert, *as I can ame* `[as I guess]`;  
Azone highte his sone by name;  
His doghter, that thise `men` wulde have,  
Thus is write, that she highte Ave.  
Echoon consented to oon wylle  
Who sholde gon Ave out to *tille* `[entice]`.  
They graunted echoon out to sende  
Bothe Wibessyne and Merswynde.  

Thise wommen *yede* `[went]` and *tollede* `[enticed]` hire oute  
With hem to carole the chirche aboute.  
Bevune ordeyned here carolyng.  
Gerlew *endited* `[dictated, suggested]` what they sholde sing.  
This is the carole that they songe,  
As telleth the Latyn tonge:  
*"Equitabat Beuo per siluam frondosam,*  
*Ducebat secum Merswyndam formosam.*  
*Quid stamus? Cur non imus?"*  
"By the *leved* `[leafy]` wode rode Bevolyne,  
With him he ledde fair Merswyne.  
Why stonde we? why gon we nought?"  
This is the carole that Grysly wroghte.  
This song songe they in the chirche-yeerd—  
Of folye were they nothing afeerd—  
Unto the matynes were alle done,  
And the messe shuld bigynne soone.  

The preest *him revest* `[vested himself]` to begynne messe,  
And they ne left ther-fore nevere-the-lesse,  
But daunsed forth as they bigonne—  
For all the messe they ne *blonne* `[ceased]`.  

The preest, that stood at the *autere* `[altar]`  
And herde her noise and her *bere* `[clamor]`,  
From the autere doun he *nam* `[took (his way)]`  
And to the chirche porche he cam,  
And seyde: "On Goddes half, I you forbidde  
That ye no lenger don swich dede;  
But cometh in on faire manere  
Goddes servise for-to-here,  
And doth at Cristen mannes lawe—  
Caroleth no more, *for Cristes awe* `[for fear of Christ]`!  
Worshipeth Him with al youre myght  
That of the virgine was born this nyght!"  

For alle his bidding lefte they noght,  
But daunsede forth as they thoght.  
The preest there-for was sore agreved;  
He preyed God, that he on bileved,  
And for Seint Magne, that He wulde so werche—  
(In whos worship set was the chirche)  
That swich a vengeaunce were on hem sent,  
Er they out of that stede were went,  
That they myghte evere right so wende  
Unto that tyme twelve-month ende.  
(In Latyn that I fond *thore* `[=ther]`  
He seyth not "twelve-month" but "evermore".);  
He cursed hem there *alsame* `[together]`  
As they carolede on her game.  
As soone as the preest hadde so spoke  
Every hond in other so faste was *loke* `[locked]`  
That no man myghte, wyth non wonder,  
That twelve-month parte hem asonder.  

The preest yede inne whan this was don  
And commaunded his sone Azone  
That he sholde gon swithe after Ave,  
Out of that carole *algate* `[by all means]` to have.  
But al to late that word was seyd,  
For on hem alle was the vengeaunce leyd.  

Azone wende wel for-to spede;  
Unto the carole *as-swithe* `[at once]` he yede.  
His suster by the arm he hente,  
And the arm from the body wente.  
Men wundrede alle, that there *wore* `[=were]`,  
And merveil mowe ye here more;  
For sith he hadde the arm in honde,  
The body yede forth *carolande* `[=carolynge]`;  
And neither body ne the arm  
Bledde never bloode, cold ne warm,  
But was as drye, with al the *haunche* `[i.e. shoulder]`,  
As of a *stok* `[stem]` were *riven* `[torn off]` a braunche.  

Azone to his fader went  
And brought him a sory present:  
"Loke, Fader," he seyde, "and have it heer,  
The arm of thy doghter dere,  
That was myn owne suster Ave,  
That I wende I myghte a save.  
Thy cursing now sene it es  
With vengeaunce on thyn owene flessh.  
*Felly* `[terribly]` thou cursedest, and over-soon;  
Thou axedest vengeaunce, thou hast thy boon."  
You *thar* `[need]` not axe if there was wo  
Wyth the preest and with many mo.  
The preest that cursed for that daunce,  
On some of his fel harde chaunce.  

He took his doghtres arm forlorn  
And buryed it on the morn.  
The nexte day the arm of Ave  
He fond it *liggyng* `[lying]` above the grave.  
He buryed it on *an other* `[a second]` day,  
And *eft* `[once more]` above the grave it lay.  
The thridde tyme he buryed it,  
And eft was it cast out of the pit.  
The preest wolde burye it no more:  
He dradde the vengeaunce *ferly* `[wondrously]` sore.  
Into the chirche he bar the arme  
For drede and doute of more harme;  
He ordeined it for-to be  
*That* `[i.e. so that]` every man myghte with eye it see.  

These men that yede so carolande  
Al that yere, hond in honde,  
They nevere out of that stede yede,  
Ne none myghte hem thennes lede.  
Ther the cursyng first bigan,  
In that place aboute they ronne,  
That never ne felt they no *werynes* `[weariness]`—  
As many bodies *for goyng* `[becuase of moving]` *dos* `[=do(n)]`—  
Ne mete ete, ne dronk drynke,  
Ne slepte only *alepy* `[(a) single]` wynke.  
Nyght ne day they wiste of non,  
Whan it was come, what it was gon;  
Frost ne snow, hayl ne reyne,  
Of colde ne hete, felte they no paine;  
Heer ne nayles nevere grewe,  
Ne *solowede* `[(were) soiled]` clothes, ne turnede hewe;  
Thonder ne lightning dide hit hem no *dere* `[harm]`—  
Goddes mercy dide hit from hem *were* `[ward off]`—  
But songe that song that the wo wroghte:  
"Why stonde we? why go we noght?"

What man shuld ther be in this lyve  
That ne wolde it see and thider *dryve* `[hasten]` ?  
The Emperour Henry come from Rome  
For-to see this *harde doom* `[harsh fate]`.  
When he hem saw he wepte sore  
For the mischief that he saw *thore* `[=ther]`.  
He did come *wrightes* `[carpenters]` for-to make  
Coveryng over hem, for tempeste sake.  
But that they wroghte, it was in vayn,  
For it cam to non `[came to nothing]` certeyn;  
For that they sette on oon day,  
On *the tother* `[the second, next]`, doun it lay.  
Ones, twyes, thries, thus they wroghte,  
And al her makyng was for noght.  
Myghte no covering *hyle* `[protect]` hem from colde  
Til tyme of mercy that Crist hem wolde.  
Tyme of grace fel thurgh His myght  
At the twelvemonth ende, on the Yole night.  

The same houre that the preest hem banned,  
The same houre atwynne they wonede;  
That houre that he cursed hem inne,  
The same houre they yede *a-twynne* `[apart]`,  
And as in twynkelyng of oon eye  
Into the chirche gonne they flye,  
And on the pavement they felle alle doun  
As they hadde ben dede, or falle in a swoun.  

Three dayes stille they lay echoon,  
That none stired other flessh or bon;  
And at the three dayes ende  
To lyf God graunted hem to wende.  
They sete up and spak *apert* `[plainly]`  
To the parishe preest, Sir Robert:  
"Thou art *ensample and enchesoun* `[warning and cause]`  
Of oure long confusioun;  
Thou maker art of oure travaile,  
That is to many greet merveil;  
And thy travail shalt thou soone ende,  
For to thy *long hom* `[eternal home]` soone shalt thou wende."  

Alle they rise that ilke tide  
But Ave: she lay *deed* `[death]` biside.  
Greet sorwe had her fader, her brother;  
Merveil and drede hadde alle other.  
I trowe no drede of soules deed,  
But with *pyne* `[suffering]` was *broght* the body *deed* `[brought dead, i.e. died]`.  
The firste man was the fader, the preest,  
That deyde after the doghter *nest* `[=next]`.  
This ilke arme that was of Ave,  
That none myghte lay in grave,  
The emperoure *dide a vessel werche* `[had a vessel made]`  
To don it in and honge in the chirche,  
That alle men myghte see it and knowe,  
And thenke on the chaunce whan they it sawe.  

Thise men that hadde gon thus carolande,  
Al the yere, fast hond in honde,  
Thogh that they were then asunder,  
Yet al the worlde spake of hem wunder.  
That same hoppyng that they first yede,  
That daunce yede they *thurgh lond and lede* `[i.e. throughout the world]`;  
And as they ne myghte first be unbounde,  
So eft togidre myghte they nevere be founde,  
Ne myghte they never come ageyn  
Togidre to oon stede, certeyn.  

Foure yede to the court of Rome  
And ever hoppyng aboute they *nome* `[took (their way)]`;  
With *sonder lepes* `[? / separate leaps]` come they thider,  
But they come never eft togidre.  
Her clothes ne roted, ne nayles grewe,  
Ne heer ne wex, ne *solowed* `[sullied]` hewe,  
Ne never hadde they *amendement* `[cure]`,  
That we herde, at any *corseint* `[shrine (of a saint)]`,  
But at the virgine Seint Edith,  
There was he *botened* `[given a remedy]`, Seint Theodoric,  
On Oure Lady Day, in Lenten-tide,  
As he slepte her toumbe biside,  
There he hadde his *medicine* `[cure]`  
At Seint Edith, the holy virgìne.  

Brunnyng the bisshop of Seint Tolous  
Wrot this tale so merveilous;  
Sith was his name of more renoun—  
Men callede him the Pope Leoun.  
This at the court of Rome they wite,  
And in the cronicles it is write  
In many stedes beyond the see  
More than is in this contree.  
Therfor men seye—and wel is trowed,  
"The neer the chirche, the forther from God."  
So *fare* `[regard]` men heer by this tale,  
Som holde it but *a trotevale* `[an idle story]`;  
In othre stedes it is full dere  
And for greet merveil they wol it here.  
A taile it is *of faire shewyng* `[i.e. that illustrates plainly]`,  
Ensaumple and drede ayeins cursyng.  
This tale I tolde you to make you afeerd  
In chirche to carole, or in chirche-yeerd,  
Namely ayeins the prestes wylle:  
Leveth, whan he biddeth you be stille.

In England, as I understand; / As I understand it,  
In the time of a king named Edward, / In the time of our King Edward:  
An event that that was so harsh. /  A truly terrible tale.

It was upon a Christmas night, / It was Christmas Eve  
That twelve fools arranged a carol, / and twelve revellers (as the chronicler describes them) arranged "a carol", which is to say, a bit of a party  
In madness, as if in competition, / As a bit of a lark  
They came to a town called Colbek. / And so they came to Colbek.  
The Church in that town that they approached / The Church there was dedicated to St Magne,  
Was St Magne's, who suffererd martyrdom; / who suffered martyrdom,  
And also St Bukcestre's, / And St Bukcestre,  
St Magnes' sister, that they came to. / His sister,

And as I know them, you shall now know them: / And as I know them you shall know them.  
The leader who led them in their glee, / The leader of the revellers  
As it was written, his name was Gerlew; / Or so it was writtten, was a named Gerlew  
Two maidens were in their band, / In their party, we two youn womoen
Maiden Merswynde and Wybessyne. / Mersynde and Wybessyne  
All these came there for a particular reason: / And the reason they came to Colbek, and that Church in particular?  
The priest's daughter of the town. / The priest's daughter.

The priest was named Robert, if I remember correctly; / The priest was called Robert, if I remember it correctly,  
His son was named Azone; /  Ans his son was called Azone.  
His daughter, whom these men would have, / His daughter — the one who the partygoers had came to meet  
And as it was written, she was called Ave. / Was called Ave.  
Each one consented to a single will, / Between them,  
Who should go to entice Ave out. / they agreed  
They agreed, each one, to send out / who should try to entice Ave out:  
Both Wybessyne and Merswynde. / Wybessyne and Merwynde.

These women went and enticed her out / The young women approached Ave,  
With them to carol around the church. / And persuaded her to join their party.  
Bevune arranged their caroling. / Bevune led the dance  
Gerlew suggested what they should sing. / And Gerlew the singing.  
This is the carol that they sang, / This is what they sang  
As the Latin tongue tells it: / I won't bother you with the original Latin  
"Equitabat Beuo per siluam frondosam,  
Ducebat secum Merswyndam formosam.  
Quid stamus? Cur non imus?"  
"By the leafy wood rode Bevolyne, / But the gist of the song was this: By the leafy wood rode Bevolyne  
With him he led fair Merswyne. / And with him the fair Merswyne.  
Why do we stand? Why do we not go?" / Why should we stand? Why do we not?  
This is the carol that Grysly composed. / This is the song that Grysly composed  
They song sang they in the churchyard— / The song they sang in the graveyard  
Of any folly they were not afraid— / With no regard to anyone else  
Until the matins were all done, / No consideration for the prayers of  parishioners  
And the Mass should begin soon. / Or the Mass that was about to begin.

The priest vested himself to begin the Mass, / The priest started to put on his robes, ready for the Mass
And they did not stop for that, nonetheless, / But that didn't stop them  
But danced on as they had begun— / They continued dancing in the same way they had begin  
They did not cease for the entire Mass. / And didn't stop through the whole of the Mass.

The priest, who stood at the altar / The priest, doing his best from the altar

Do not carol any more, for fear of Christ! / And just stop your dancing for now

Who of the Virgin was born this night!" / On this Holy night.
