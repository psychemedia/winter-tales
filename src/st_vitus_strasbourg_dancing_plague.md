CHAPTER IV.

FROM A.D. 1418 TO 1530.

A. D. 1418, Strasburgh was visited by the "Dancing Plague" and the same infatuation existed amongst the people there, as in the towns of Belgium and the Lower Rhine a. d. 1374; many who were seized on seeing the affected, excited attention at first by their confused and absurd behaviour, and then by their constantly following the swarms of dancers. These were seen day and night passing through the streets, accompanied by musicians playing on bagpipes, and by innumerable spectators attracted by curiosity, to whom were added anxious parents and relations who came to look after those among the misguided multitude who belonged to their respective families.

Imposture and profligacy played their part in this city also, but the morbid delusion itself seems to have predominated. On this account religion could only bring provisional aid, and therefore the Town Council benevolently took an interest in the afflicted: they divided them into separate parties, to each of which they appointed responsible superintendents, to protect them from harm, and perhaps also to restrain their turbulence. They were thus conducted on foot and in carriages to the chapels of St. Vitus, near Zabern, and Rotestein, where priests were in attendance to influence their misguided minds by masses and other religious ceremonies. After divine worship was completed, they were led in solemn procession to the altar, where they made some small offering of alms, and where, it is probable, many, through the influence of devotion and the sanctity of the place, were cured of this lamentable aberration.

It is worthy of observation, at all events, that the dancing mania did not recommence at the altars of the saint, that from him alone assistance was implored, and that through his miraculous interposition a cure was expected, which was beyond the reach of human skill. The personal history of St. Vitus is by no means unimportant in this matter. He was a Sicilian youth, who, together with Modestus and Crescentia, suffered martyrdom at the time of the persecution of the Christians under Diocletian, in a.d. 303. The legends respecting him are obscure, and he would certainly have been passed over without notice among the innumerable apocryphal martyrs of the earliest centuries, had not the transfer of his body to St. Denys, and thence in the year 836 to Corvey, raised him to a higher rank. From this time forth it may be supposed that many miracles v/ere performed at his new sepulchre, which were of essential service in confirming the Roman Catholic faith among the Germans, and St. Vitus was soon ranked among the fourteen saintly helpers (Nothelfer or Apotheker). His altars were multiplied, and the people had recourse to them in all kinds of distresses; they revered him as a powerful intercessor. As the worship of these saints was, however, at that time stripped of all historical connexions, which were purposely obliterated by the priesthood, a legend was invented at the beginning of the fifteenth century, or perhaps even so early as the fourteenth, that St. Vitus had, just before he bent his neck to the sword, prayed to God that he might protect from the dancing mania all those who should solemnize the day of his commemoration and fast upon its eve, and that thereupon a voice from heaven was heard, saying, "Vitus, thy prayer is accepted." Thus St. Vitus became the patron saint of those affected with the dancing plague, as St. Martin of Tours was at one time the succourer of persons in small pox; St. Anthony, of those suffering under the 'hellish fire;' and as St. Margaret was the Juno Lucina of pregnant women.

*The Dancing Mania.*—Chorea has appeared in various epidemic forms under the names of St. Vitus's dance, St. Guy's dance, St. Anthony's dance, choromania, tanzplage, orchestromania, dance of St. Modesti or St. John, the dancing mania, etc.; although these various functional phenomena of the neryous system have been called chorea, they bear very little resemblance to what, at the present day, is called by this name. The epidemic form appeared about 1374, although Hecker claims that, at that time, it was no new thing. Assemblages of men and women were seen at Aix-la-Chapelle who, impelled by a common delusion, would form circles, hand in hand, and dance in wild delirium until they fell to the ground exhausted, somewhat after the manner of the Ghost-Dance or Messiah-Dance of our North American Indians. In their Bacchantic leaps they were apparently haunted by visions and hallucinations, the fancy conjuring up spirits whose names they shrieked out. Some of them afterward stated that they appeared to be immersed in a stream of blood which obliged them to leap so high. Others saw the heavens open and disclose the Saviour enthroned with the Virgin Mary. The participants seemed to suffer greatly from tympanites which was generally relieved by compression or thumping on the abdomen. A few months after this dancing malady had made its appearance at Aix-la-Chapelle it broke out at Cologne, and about the same time at Metz, the streets of which were said to have been filled with 1100 dancers. This rich city became the scene of the most ruinous disorder. Peasants left their plows, mechanics their shops, servants their masters, children their homes; and beggars and idle vagabonds, who understood how to imitate the convulsions, roved from place to place, inducing all sorts of crime and vice among the afflicted. Strasburg was visited by the dancing plague in 1418, and it was here that the plague assumed the name of St. Vitus's dance. St. Vitus was a Sicilian youth who, just at the time he was about to undergo martyrdom by order of Diocletian, in the year 303, is said to have prayed to God that He might protect all those who would solemnize the day of his commemoration and fast upon its eve. The people were taught that a voice from heaven was then heard saying, "Vitus, thy prayer is accepted."

Paracelsus called this malady (Chorus sancti viti) the lascivious dance, and says that persons stricken with it were helpless until relieved by either recovery or death. The malady spread rapidly through France and Holland, and before the close of the century was introduced into England. In his "Anatomy of Melancholy" Burton refers to it, and speaks of the idiosyncrasies of the individuals afflicted. It is said they could not abide one in red clothes, and that they loved music above all things, and also that the magistrates in Germany hired musicians to give them music, and provided them with sturdy companions to dance with. Their endurance was marvelous. Plater speaks of a woman in Basle whom he saw, that danced for a month. In Strasburg many of them ate nothing for days and nights until their mania subsided. Paracelsus, in the beginning of the sixteenth century, was the first to make a study of this disease. He outlined the severest treatment for it, and boasted that he cured many of the victims. Hecker conjectures that probably the wild revels of St. John's day, 1374, gave rise to this mental plague, which thenceforth visited so many thousands with incurable aberrations of mind and disgusting distortions of the body. Almost simultaneous with the dance of "St. With," there appeared in Italy and Arabia a mania very similar in character which was called ''tarantism,'' which was supposed to originate in the bite of the tarantula. The only effective remedy was music in some form. In the Tigré country, Abyssinia, this disease appeared under the name of "Tigretier." The disease, fortunately, rapidly declined, and very little of it seems to have been known in the sixteenth century, but in the early part of the eighteenth century a peculiar sect called the "Convulsionnaires" arose in France; and throughout England among the Methodist sect, insane convulsions of this nature were witnessed; and even to the present day in some of the primitive religious meetings of our people, something not unlike this mania of the Middle Ages is perpetuated.

Paracelsus divided the sufferers of St. Vitus's dance into three classes:—

(1) Those in which the affliction arose from imagination (chorea imaginativa).

(2) Those which had their origin in sexual desires depending on the will.

(3) Those arising from corporeal causes (chorea naturalis). This last case, according to a strange notion of his own he explained by maintaining that in certain vessels which are susceptible of an internal pruriency, and thence produced laughter, the blood is set into commotion in consequence of an alteration in the vital spirits, whereby are occasioned involuntary fits of intoxicating joy, and a propensity to dance. The great physician Sydenham gave the first accurate description of what is to-day called chorea, and hence the disease has been named "Sydenham's chorea." So true to life was his portrayal of the disease that it has never been surpassed by modern observers.

CHAPTER XIII.

EPIDEMIC HYSTERIA, CONVULSIVE CHOREA; — LA MANIE DE LA DANSE, OF THE FRENCH — THE TARANTULA DANCING EPIDEMIC OF APULIA.

FOURTEENTH TO SIXTEENTH CENTURIES.

The workings of the human mind, in various circumstances affecting the nervous system and the senses, and at various epochs, marked by signal terrestrial commotions, visitations of pestilence or famine, political convulsions, or revolutions in religious opinions, afford a subject of inquiry, of no slight interest and importance.

The 14th century, and greater portion of the 15th, abounded in calamities occasioned either by pestilence or strife: and their results are very obvious in various maniacal forms of fanaticism, which prevailed in the manner of epidemics, and were confounded with demoniac influences and afflictions, mental and corporeal.

"The mind and the body," says Dr. Babington, the translator of Hecker's "Dancing Mania," "reciprocally and mysteriously affect each other, and the maladies which are the subject of these pages are so intimately connected with the disordered state of both, that it is often difficult to determine, on which they more essentially depend, or which they more seriously influence."

Perhaps there never was a period in the history of the world, so pregnant with great national calamities throughout Europe as that of the 14th century. The great pestilence, aptly designated "The Black Death," which had consigned it is estimated a third of the human race to the grave, had not wholly subsided, when a new malady of a convulsive nervous and maniacal character, burst out in Germany about 1374, of a more strange nature than any previous malady that had afflicted humanity so extensively as to deserve the name of an epidemic.

The dancing mania connected with Demonomania, made its way into some parts of Flanders and Germany, after many signal calamities from pestilence, war, and civil feuds. This dancing disease, we are told, "was a great epidemic of a severe nervous malady, of which the present St. Vitus's dance is the feeble echo."

The afflicted generally believed they were possessed by demons; they tormented their minds with dreadful images of judgments on sins of theirs which had' brought this grievous affliction on them, and they were exorcised very often with indifferent success. No one thought of dealing medicinally with their disease.

The earliest mention of the German dancing mania, I find in any contemporaneous historical work, is in the "Annales de Flandes," por Emanuel Sueyro, in the Spanish tongue, (in fol. Anvers. 1624), under date 1374; the following notice occurs of" La Secta de los Dangantes."

"It was accounted portentous of succeeding ills, the exhibition in those days of the madness with which, from the confines of the Rhine and the Moselle, descended on Flanders so great a multitude of people who went dancing and singing through the towns, in troops of a hundred and of fifty, as if impelled by some fury: no one knew how it arose, or where first appeared this tumultuous disorder, which the laws were ill able to repress."

"Tuvose por prodigio de los males siguentes, y el haver visto en los mismos dias la locura, con que de los confines del Rhiu y de la Mosa, baxd a Flandes van tan gran multitud de gente, que van dangando y cantando por las villas en tropas de ciento, y de cinquenta; como impelidos de algun furor: no se sabe como ni adonde pard este desatino, que podian mal reprimir las leyes." `[Annales de Flandes. Por Emanuel Sveyro. 1624. p. 556.]`

Hecker states, that so early as 1374 large assemblages of persons of both sexes were seen at Aix-la-Chapelle, who had come out of Germany, united by one common delusion, and shewed to the public and in the street the strongest spectacle. Circles joined hand in hand, strangely excited, apparently deprived of all command over their senses and of their reason, dancing continually for hours together, regardless of bystanders `[Hecker. The Dancing Mania. Babington's Edition of the Epidemics of the Middle Ages. Lond. 1844. p. 88.]`.

In Belgium the affected persons were called Dansatores Ghorisantes; elsewhere they were called St. John's Dancers, and St. Vitus's Dancers.

St. Vitus's Dance, — the "Chorea Sancti Vita," known to medical authors, is described as an habitual convulsive malady, chiefly affecting the voluntary muscles of the extremities, face, head and neck of debilitated children, boys and girls, from eight to fourteen years of age indiscriminately, and sometimes, but rarely, young women at the age of puberty j a disease accompanied generally with derangement of the digestive organs, a variable and often ravenous appetite, tumescence of the stomach and lower viscera, and subsidence of the convulsive movements during sleep.

But this description of the ordinary disease gives no idea of the Dancing Plague of the 14th century. It had been heard of however so early as the 11th century in Germany, in Anhalt near Bembourg, associated with a curse. In 1237 it is said to have prevailed at Erfurt, and traditions remained of upwards of 100 children having been seen dancing and jumping on the public roads, and sinking exhausted by the violence and duration of their paroxysms. Forty-one years later, in 1278, an outbreak of this disease is said to have taken place at Utrecht, and 200 of those attacked perished by the falling of abridge, on the occasion of a priest passing, who was conveying the blessed sacrament to a sick person, and while they were in the midst of their uninterrupted orgies.

This catastrophe acquired the character of a Divine of the bagpipes, which was a favourite instrument with the elect, especially in the Rhenish Provinces of Germany. And then the dancing orgies ensued, and the humiliating spectacle of human beings in multitudes rushing into all sorts of extravagances, as if the inmates of all the Bedlams of the land had been let loose, and were then congregated in one place, for the delirious exercises of bounding, jumping, tramping, panting as if they were ready to die, and dancing as if they would never cease, if it were possible, to make the last moment of their lives coincident with the kicking of their feet.

The preposterousness of their infatuation in Belgium could not be exceeded, the dancers flocked to the assemblies with garlands in their hair, tricked out for the orgies, as if they came prepared for bridal festivities.

But in strange contrast with the garlands appeared the bandages on their person, prepared for the swathing after the mad dance was over, all in readiness on the waist for twisting tightly by means of a stick used for that purpose, when the attack of the tympanitic distension should ensue and necessitate that remedy.

In Liege the fanatics assembled in large multitudes, raved about the sins of the world, preached against its wickedness, denounced the worshippers of the devils who invented fashions and suggested all innovations in attire.

And yet the "The Demon fashion" of the fifteenth

age had little to answer for, compared with the diabolical milliners of the nineteenth century, who have bewitched womankind with crinoline.

The poor dancing fanatics of Germany and of Belgium of the middle ages had no awful exaggerations of human nature, and alarming consumption of silken materials for the attire of those enlarged dimensions, to bewail in their penitential sermons. The}' had only to weep over the wickedness of shoes pointed at the toes, and the weakness of the sex as it was manifested in those times, in a passion for trinkets, and other vanities which those daughters of Eve inherited from their grandmothers, if not from the first mother of mankind.

The dancing plague broke out in Strasburg in 1418. The symptoms were the same as in other places in previous visitations of the epidemic. People affected went about in strolling bands, accompanied by musicians pla} T ing on bagpipes, dancing with frantic violence, and followed by great crowds of idle and disorderly people of profligate habits. The ranks of the dancing maniacs were kept up by constant accession either of impostors, who became eventually affected by the attraits impulsifs , of imitation and contagion of familiar intercourse long continued with a phrenzied multitude, or by the numbers of the friends and relatives of the afflicted, who followed them from motives of affection, and who by the force of sympathy were drawn within the influence of this powerful delusion.

The authorities of Strasburg and other places in the Rhenish Provinces, appointed superintendents to watch over the affected, and to aid them in proceeding to certain chapels dedicated to St. Vitus, near Zabem and Rotestein, where the clergy ministered to them, and special religious services were performed, in which hundreds earnestly engaged. Hecker, not much disposed to favour any views which he believes superstitious, acknowledges that by these means "it is probable that many were through the influence of devotion and the sanctity of the place cured of this lamentable aberration." And he states moreover, "it was worthy of observation that the dancing mania did not recommence at the altars of the saint, and that from him alone assistance was implored, and through his miraculous interposition a cure was expected which was beyond the reach of human skill."

The reasons why particular saints are singled out of the Calendar as patrons, specially devoted to the interests, or propitious to the prayers of sick people peculiarly diseased, appear more unaccountable than they are in reality. The saint who becomes renowned for cures effected by his intercession in cases of disease called St. Vitus's dance finds no clients among those affected with the malady designated St. Anthony's fire. And yet, although there is no ground for believing that St. Vitus, or St. John the Baptist ever suffered from hystero-convulsive-chorea, or had any knowledge of that malady, more than St. Anthony or any other saint, we find reasons given in their lives for the peculiar veneration in which their memories were held by persons suffering under particular visitations. St. Vitus, son of Hylas, a Gentile magnate, was born in Mazara,in Sicily, in the time of Diocletian; while yet a child, we are told by llibadeneira, `[Lives of the Saints. From the Spanish of the Rev. Father Peter Ribadencira. 3rd Ed. Dubliu, 17(i3. p. 270, 2nd part]` he manifested extraordinary piety, and even in childhood "began to work great miracles, healing the sick, casting out devils, and doing such other wonderful things, for God had chosen him from that most tender age to manifest his glory in him, and by him." He was rescued out of the hands of persecution by Modestus and Crescentia, and finally conveyed to Home. The great fame of St. Vitus for sanctity and miraculous gifts, made him known to the Emperor Diocletian, who availed himself of the signal spiritual gifts to rescue a child of his from the power of the demon by whom that child was possessed. By the prayers of St. Vitus the child was delivered from the evil spirit, as we are informed; but the young saint refusing the proffered favour of the Emperor, and the conditions on which it was offered, namely, of abjuring Christ, and adoring the gods of paganism, he was cast into prison in Lucania, together with Modestus and Crescentia. The Emperor finally ordered them to be thrown into a cauldron of boiling pitch, and other inflammable compounds, to see whether their God could deliver them out of his hands. Signing the cauldron with the sign of the cross they entered in a holy transport of hope and joy, singing praises and hymns to God, and they came forth unhurt, in the presence of twenty thousand people. Diocletian then ordered them to be put to death on a scaffold stretched on the Catasta, where they endured the most frightful torments. These had not ceased before a furious tempest and earthquake ensued, which buried several temples of the Pagan gods, and killed many of their worshippers. The Emperor fled in consternation, and acknowledged he was overcome by a Christian boy. Then appeared an angel of the Lord who delivered the confessors from their torments, and carried them to the banks of a river, and placed them under a tree, and there the martyrs gave up their souls to God on the 15th of June, a. d. 303, and were honourably buried. The domain of history borders on the confines of legendary lore: but, though often confounded with the latter, is still separable from it in some important particulars.

The body of St. Vitus was moved to Apulia in 072, afterwards translated to St. Denis in France, and in 836 to the abbey of Corvey in Saxony. Some of the relics in 775 had been obtained by Wenceslaus, king of Bohemia, and enshrined in a church built to his honour in Prague. The power ascribed to St. Vitus of casting out devils and performing miraculous cures was then the cause of the trust reposed in his intercession, and the recourse to it of those afflicted with a disease generally considered as one of supernatural origin in the 15th century. The festival of St. Vitus occurs on the 10th of June

St. John the Baptist was no less a patron saint of those afflicted with the dancing mania than St. Vitus.

The great powers and privileges of this saint, predicted even before his birth, may have contributed in part to the patronage of St. John being so earnestly sought by all labouring under diseases supposed to be connected with diabolical agencies. The command to Zachary, "Thou shalt call his name John, and he shall be great before God," his prophetic gifts and especial graces, the prodigies connected with his mission, the spirit of poverty and mortification which sanctified his solitude in the wilderness, all these considerations served to invest the character of the Baptist with those traits of power and divine influence which gave to his patronage peculiar advantages in the eyes of those subjected to ills regarded as supernatural. The festival of St. J ohn occurs on the 24th of June.

But legendary lore had much to do with the connexion of the name and patronage of St. John the Baptist with the dancing mania of the 14th century. Not only formerly in Germany, but in several other countries, and in Ireland, within my own recollection, the festival of St. John and the eve of it were solemnized by bonfires; leaping through the flames; by patterns at holy wells dedicated to the Saint; by music and dancing*.

In the East both Greeks and Latins celebrate this festival with modes of rejoicing of a very heathenish character, and in the Greek churches particularly with squibs, crackers, fireworks, and discharge of pistols; more like Bacchanalian orgies than Christian usages.

In Germany the Pagan custom of kindling the Nodfyr had been transferred to the festival of St. John's day, and was solemnized with dancing and leaping through the flames, like a sort of baptism of fire: notwithstanding the denunciation of these orgies by St. Boniface. The same custom on this festival appears to have existed in the time of St. Augustine, and met with similar denunciations by him.

The accounts, in fact, given by various writers of the bonfire revels of the middle ages in honour of St. John's festival, the jumping through the flames, and passing children through them for the prevention of diseases for the ensuing year, and the running round the fire with brands, or dancing in circles with them in their hands, would lead one to imagine no slight vestige of the ancient Homan lustration by fire in the Palilia was to be found in these usages of St. John's fires.

Hecker couples the first appearance of the dancing maniacs in Aix-la-Chapelle in July, soon after the festival of the Baptist, with the fact of their uttering in their exclamations the name of St. John, and says: "The conjecture is probable that the wild revels of St. John's day, a. d. 1374, gave rise to this mental plague, which thenceforth has visited so many thousands with incurable aberration of intellect and disgusting distortions of body."

The dancing mania of Germany of the 15th century is still kept in popular remembrance in some places, by an annual festival, especially^ at Echter* nach, a small town in Luxembourg, about twenty miles from Treves, where thousands of people annually meet on Whit-Tuesday to solemnize this feast with what is termed "the jumping procession," and also the procession of the jumping saints. "The ancient practice thus annually honoured, originated," says a correspondent in Notes and Queries, "in the 14th century, and obtained the name of St. Vitus's dance. It first broke out in the Archbishopric of Treves and Cologne and other parts of Germany. The name was derived from a chapel in Ulm, dedicated to St. Vitus, which was much in vogue with those afflicted with the disease, who flocked here in crowds to entreat the saint's intercession in their behalf. There were men of the time who observed that those who suffered under the disease were afflicted with spasmodic movements of the limbs which forced them to dance and jump about like madmen, without any power over their own will, until they fell down in a state of exhaustion. These observers conceived the idea, that by voluntarily going through the same process, and performing the same fatiguing movements they might ward off the disease itself — a curious foreshadowing of the system of Jenner and Hahnemann. Acting upon this idea, the festival of the procession of the Jumpers was formed: and once a year, on Whit-Tuesday, that procession still wends its way to the grave of St. Willebrodus in the ancient abbey church of Ecliternach. The procession starts from the bridge accompanied by several bands of music. The pilgrims of both sexes form in rows and spring first four steps forward and three back, then eight forward and three back: and so on, continually increasing the steps forward, but making no change in those backward, until they reach the church, where they throw themselves on their faces and begin to pray. Having entered the church, after prayer, the flag bearers and brothers of the order place themselves under the great lustre, with its seventy-two lighted tapers, and high mass, accompanied by solemn music, begins. I should have mentioned that the jumping march is performed to curious old music, composed expressly for this ceremony. So many evils arose from bringing such masses of people together in so small a compass, so much drunkenness, riot, and debauchery, that the festival was suppressed by law in 1777; it was, however, re-introduced by Joseph II. in 1790; put down by the French in 1795, and again appeared in 1802, in which year there were nearly 3000 dancers and 74 musicians. In the year 1812 there were 12,678 dancers in the procession, which has, however, now diminished to an annual average of 8000." `[Notes and Queries, September, 1856]`

THE EPIDEMICS OF THE MIDDLE AGES

...

Amongst the consequences of the plague, Dr. Hecker notices that the church acquired treasures and large properties in land, even to to a greater extent than after the Crusades; and that, on the subsidence of the calamity, many entered the priesthood, or flocked to the monasteries, who had no other motive than to _participate in this wealth. He adds, also, that,—

"After the cessation of the Black Plague, a greater fecundity in women was everywhere remarkable—a grand phenomenon, which, from" its occurrence after every destructive pestilence, proves to conviction, if any occurrence can do so, the prevalence of a higher power in the direction of general organic life. Marriages were, almost. without exception, prolific, and double and treble births were more frequent than at other times; under which head we should remember the strange remark, that after the 'great mortality' the children were said to have got fewer teeth than before; at which contemporaries were mightily shocked, and even later writers have felt surprise.

"If we,examine the grounds of this oft-repeated assertion, we shall find that they were astonished to see children cut twenty, or at most twenty-two teeth, ate the supposition that a greater number had formerly fallen to their share. Some writers of authority, as, for example, the physician Savonarola, at Ferrara, who probably looked for twenty-eight teeth in children, published their opinions on this subject. Others copied from them without seeing for themselves, as often happens in other matters which are equally evident; and thus the world believed in a miracle of an imperfection in the human body, which had been caused by the Black Plague."

That a fresh impetus would be given to population seems to us quite sufficiently accounted for, without calling into aid any "higher power in the direction of general organic life." Men and women would marry early; and the very fact of their having survived the plague would, in general, prove that they were healthy subjects, or had been well and temperately brought up. There would be the same impetus to population that an extensive emigration would cause, and an emigration that had carried away most of the sick and the feeble. The belief that double and treble births were more frequent than at other times, may perhaps be explained in the same manner as the belief that there were fewer teeth than before in the human head. No accurate observations had been at all made upon the subject.

We come next in order to The Dancing Mania—an epidemic of a quite different character. Not, indeed, as the name might imply, that the convulsive dance was a very slight affliction—it was felt to be quite otherwise; but because it belongs to that class of nervous maladies in which there is great room for mental or psychical influence. Such disorders spring up in a certain condition of the body, but the form they assume will depend on social circumstances, or the ideas current at the time. And thus Dr. Hecker finds no difficulty in arranging the Conrulsionnaires of France, or the early Methodists of England and Wales, in the same category as the maniacal dancers of Germany. It was in all the cases a physical tendency of a similar character, brought out under the influence of different ideas.

Dr. Hecker mentions a case which, from the simplicity of the facts, would form a good introduction to others of a more complicated character. In the year 1787, at a cotton-manufactory at Hodden Bridge, in Lancashire, a girl put a mouse into the bosom of another girl, who had a great dread of mice. It threw her into a fit, and the fit continued, with the most violent convulsions, for twenty-four hours. On the following day three other girls were seized in the same way; on the day after six more. A report was now spread that a strange disease had been introduced into the factory by a bag of cotton opened in the house. Others who had not even seen the infected, but only heard of their convulsions, were seized with the same fits. In three days, the number of the sufferers had reached to twenty-four. The symptoms were, a sense of great anxiety, strangulation, and very strong convulsions, which lasted from one to twenty-four hours, and of so violent a nature that it required four or five persons to prevent the patients from tearing their hair, and dashing their heads against the floor and walls. Dr. St. Clare was sent for from Preston. Dr. St. Clare deserves to have his name remembered. The ingenious man took with him a portable electrical machine The electric shock cured all his patients without an exception. When this was known, and the belief could no longer hold its ground that the plague had been brought in by the cotton bag, no fresh person was affected.

If we substitute for the cotton bag a belief in some demoniacal influence, compelling people to dance against their will, we have the dancing mania of Germany. Unhappily there was no St. Clare at hand, with his electrical machine, to give a favourable shock to body and mind at once, and thus disperse the malady before it gathered an overpowering strength by the very numbers of the infected.

"The effects of the Black Death," writes Dr. Hecker (whose account of the disorder we cannot do better than give, with some abridgments), "had not yet subsided, when a strange delusion arose in Germany. It was a convulsion which in the most extraordinary manner infuriated the human frame, and excited the astonishment of contemporaries for more than two centuries, since which time it has never reappeared. It was called the Dance of St. John, or of St. Vitus, on account of the Bacchantic leaps by which it was characterised, and which gave to those affected, whilst performing their wild dance, and screaming and foaming with fury, all the appearance of persons possessed. It did not remain confined to particular localities, but was propagated by the sight of the sufferers like a demoniacal epidemic, over the whole of Germany and the neighbouring

"So early as the year 1374, assemblages of men and women were seen at Aix-la-Chapelle, who had come out of vane and who, united by one common delusion, exhibited to the public, both in the streets and in the churches, the following strange spectacle. They formed circles hand in hand, and, appearing to have lost all control over their senses, continued dancing, regardless of the bystanders, for hours together, in wild delirium, until at length they fell to the ground in a state of exhaustion. They then complained of extreme oppression, and groaned as if in the agonies of death, until they were swathed in clothes, bound tightly round their waists, upon which they again recovered, and remained free from complaint until the next attack. This practice of swathing was resorted to on account of the tympany which followed these spasmodic ravings; but the bystanders frequently relieved patients in a less artificial manner, by thumping or trampling upon the parts affected. While dancing, they neither saw nor heard, being insensible to external impressions through the senses, but were haunted by visions, their fancies conjuring up spirits, whose names they shrieked out; and some of them afterwards asserted that they felt as if they had been immersed in a stream of blood, which obliged them to leap so high. Others, during the paroxysm, saw the heavens open, and the Saviour enthroned with the Virgin Mary according as the religious notions of the age were strangely and variously reflected in their imaginations."

The disease spread itself in two directions. It extended from Aix-la-Chapelle through the towns of the Netherlands, and also through the Rhenish towns. In Liege, Utrecht, and many other towns of Belgium, the dancers appeared with garlands in their hair, and their waists already girt with a cloth or bandage, that they might receive immediate relief in the attack of the tympany. It seems that the crowd around were often more ready to administer relief by kicks and blows than by drawing this bandage tight. The most opposite feelings seem to have been excited in the multitude by these exhibitions. Sometimes an idle and vicious mob would take advantage of them, and they became the occasion of much rot and debauchery. More frequently, however, the demoniacal origin of the disease, of which few men doubted, led to its being regarded with astonishment and horror. Religious processions were instituted on its account, masses and hymns were sung, and the whole power of the priesthood was called in to exorcise the evil spirit. The malady rose to its greatest height in some of the towns on the Rhine. At Cologne the number of the possessed amounted to more than five hundred, whilst at Metz the streets are said to have been filled (numbering women and children together) with eleven hundred dancers. Even those idle vagabonds who, for their own purposes, imitated their convulsive movements, assisted to spread the disorder; for in these maladies the susceptible are infected quite as easily by the imitation as by the reality.

The physicians stood aloof. Acknowledged as a demoniacal possession, they left the treatment of the disease entirely to the priesthood; and their exorcisms were not without avail. But it was necessary to this species of remedy that the patients should have faith in the church and its holy ministers. Without faith there would certainly, in such a case, be no cure; and, unhappily, the report had been spread by some irreverend schismaties that the disorder itself was owing— to what will our readers suppose /—to an imperfect baptism—to the baptism of children by the hands of unchaste priests. Where this notion prevailed, the exorcism, we necd not say, was unavailing.

The malady first bore the name of St. John's Dance, afterwards that of St. Vitus's. This second name it took from the mere circumstance that St. Vitus was the saint appealed to for its cure. A legend had been framed with a curious disregard—even for a legend—of all history and chronology, in which St. Vitus, who suffered martyrdom, as the church records, under the Emperor Domitian, is described as praying, just before he bent his neck to the sword, that he might protect from the Dancing Mania all those who should solemnise the day of his commemoration, and fast upon its eve. The prayer was granted; a voice from heaven was heard saying, "Vitus, thy prayer is accepted." He became, of course, the patron saint of those afflicted with the dancing plague. But the name under which it first appeared, of St. John's Dance, receives from Dr. Hecker an explanation which points out to us a probable origin of the disease itself, or of the peculiar form which it assumed,

"The connection," he says, "which John the Baptist had with the dancing mania of the fourteenth century, was of a totally different character. He was originally far from being a protecting saint to those who were attacked, or one who would be likely to give them relief from a malady considered as the work of the devil. On the contrary, the manner in which he was worshipped afforded an important and very evident cause for its development. From the remotest period, perhaps even so far back as the fourth century, St. John's day was solemnised with all sorts of strange and rude customs, of which the original mystical meaning was variously disfigured among different nations by superadded relics of heathenism. Thus the Germans transferred to the festival of St. John's day an ancient heathen usage—the kindling of the 'hodfyr,' which was forbidden them by St. Boniface; and the belief subsists even tothe present day, that people and animals that have leaped through these flames, or their smoke, are protected for a whole year from fevers and other diseases, as if by a kind of baptism by fire. Bacchanalian dances, which have originated from similar causes among all the rude nations of the earth, and the wild extravagancies of a heated imagination, were the constant accompaniments of this half-heathen, half-christian festival."

In a note at a subsequent page, Dr. Hecker cites some curious passages to show what in the middle ages took place at "St. John's fires.' Bones, horns, and other rubbish were heaped together to be consumed in smoke, while persons of all ages danced round the flames as if they had been possessed. Others seized burning flambeaus, and made a circuit of the fields, in the supposition that they thereby screened them.from danger; while others again turned a cartwheel, to represent the retrograde movement of the sun. The last circumstance takes back the imagination to the old primitive worship of the sun; and perhaps the very fires of St. John might date their history from those kindled in honour of Baal or Moloch. Dr. Hecker suggests that mingling with these heathen traditions or customs a remembrance of the history of St. John's death— that dance which occasioned his decapitation—might also have had its share in determining the peculiar manner in which this saint's day should be observed. - However that may be, as we find that the first dancers in Aix-la-Chapelle appeared with St. John's name in their mouths, the conjecture is very probable that the wild revels of St. John's day had given rise, if not to the disease, yet to the type or form in which it appeared.

At a subsequent period, indeed, when the disorder had assumed, if we may so speak, a more settled aspect, the name of St. John was no otherwise associated with it than the name of St. Vitus. People danced upon his festival to obtain a cure. And these periodical dances, while they relieved the patients, assisted also to perpetuate the malady. Throughout the whole of June, we are told, prior to the festival of St. John, many men felt a disquietude and _ recklessness which they were unable to overcome. They were dejected, timid, and anxious; wandered about in an unsettled state, being tormented with twitching pains, which seized them suddenly in different parts; they eagerly expected the eve of St. John's day, in the confident hope that, by dancing at the altars of this saint, they would be freed from all their sufferings. Nor were they disappointed. By dancing and raving for three hours to the utmost scope of their desires, they obtained peace for the rest of the year. Fora long time, however, we hear of cases which assumed the most terrific form. Speaking of a period which embraced the close of the fifteenth century, Dr. Hecker says:—

The St. Vitus's dance attacked people of al! stations, especially those who led a sedentary life, such as shoemakers and tailors; but even the most robust peasants abandoned their labours in the fields, as if they were possessed by evil spirits; and thus those affected were seen assembling indiscriminately from time to time, at certain appointed places, and, unless prevented by the lookers-on, continuing to dance without intermission, until their very last breath was expended. Their fury and extravagance of demeanour so completely deprived them of their senses, that many of them dashed their brains out against the walls and corners of buildings, or rushed headlong into rapid rivers, where they found a watery grave. Roaring and foaming as they were, the bystanders could only succeed in restraining them by placing benches and chairs in their way, so that, by the high leaps we A were tempted to take, their strength might be exhausted."

Music, however, was a still better resource. It excited, but it hastened forward the paroxysm, and doubtless reduced it to some measure and rhythm. The magistrates even hired musicians for the purpose of carrying the dancers the more rapidly through the attack, and directed that athletic men should be sent among them, in order to complete their exhaustion. A marvellous story is related on the authority of one Felix Platier: Several powerful men being commissioned to dance with a girl who had the dancing mania till she had recovered from her disorder; they successively relieved each other, and danced on for the space of four weeks! at the end of which time the patient fell down exhausted, was carried to an hospital, and there recovered. She had never once undressed, was entirely regardless of the pain of her lacerated feet, and had merely sat down occasionally to take some nourishment or to slumber, and even then "the hopping movement of her body continued."

Happily, however, this mania grew more rare every year, so that in the beginning of the seventeenth century we may be said to be losing sight of it in Germany. Nor shall we follow out its history further in that country, because the same disorder, under a different form, made its appearance in Italy, and we must by no means neglect to notice the dancing mania which was so universally attributed to the bite of the tarantula, Whatever part the festival of St. John the Baptist performed in Germany, as an exciter of the disease, that part was still more clearly performed in Italy by the popular belief in the venom of a spider.

We shall not go back with Dr. Hecker into the fears or superstitions of classical times as to the bite of certain spiders or lizards; we must keep more strictly to our text; we must start from the period when men's minds were still open to pain and alarm on account of the frequent return of the plague.

"The bite of venomous spiders, or rather the unreasonable fear of its consequences, excited at such a juncture, though it could not have done so at an earlier period, a violent nervous disorder, which, like St. Vitus's dance in Germany, spread by sympathy, increasing in severity as it took a wider range, and still further extending its ravages from its long continuance. Thus, from the middle of the fourteenth century, the furies of The Dance brandished their scourge over afflicted mortals; and music, for which the inhabitants of Italy now probably for the first time manifested susceptibility and talent, became capable of exciting ecstatic attacks in those affected, and thus furnished the magical means of exorcising their melancholy."

Does the learned doctor insinuate that the Italians owed their natural taste for music to this invasion of Tarantism?

"At the close of the fifteenth century we find that Tarantism had spread beyond the boundaries of Apulia, and that the fear of being bitten by venomous spiders had increased. Nothing short of death itself was expected from the wound which these insects inflicted; and if those who were bitten escaped with their lives, they were said to be pining away in a desponding state of lassitude. Many became weak-sighted or hard of hearing; some lost the power of speech; and all were insensible to ordinary causes of excitement. Nothing but the flute or the cithern afforded them relief. At the sound of these instruments they awoke as if by enchantment, opened their eyes, and moving slowly at first, according to the measure of the music, were, as the time quickened, gradually hurried on to the most passionate dance. It was generally observable that country people, who were rude and ignorant of music, evinced on these occasions an unusual degree of grace, as if they had been well practised in elegant movements of the body; for it is a peculiarity in nervous disorders of this kind that the organs of motion are in an altered condition, and are completely under the control of the overstrained spirits."

This increased agility and grace of movement is by no means to be discredited by the reader. It is a symptom which distinguishes one class of epileptic patients. Some have attributed it to an over-excitement of the cerebellum. However that may be, there are greater wonders than this contained in our most sober and trustworthy books on the disorders of the nervous system. We continue the account:—

"Cities and villages alike resounded throughout the summer season with the notes of fifes, clarinets, and Turkish drums; and patients were everywhere to be met with who looked to dancing as their only remedy. Alexander ab Alexandro, who gives this account, saw a young man in a remote village who was seized with a violent attack of Tarantism. He listened with eagerness and a fixed stare to the sound of a drum, and his graceful movements gradually became more and more violent, until his dancing was converted into a succession of frantic leaps, which required the utmost exertion of his whole strength. In the midst of this overstrained exertion of mind and body the music suddenly ceased, and he immediately fell powerless to the ground, where he lay senseless and motionless until its magical effect again aroused him to a renewal of his impassioned performances."

We have put the expression "mind and body" in italics, because we may as well take this opportunity to observe, that although convulsions of this kind are excited, and assume a certain form on account of the predominance of some idea, yet, when once called forth, they are almost entirely mechanical in their nature. Mere animal excitability—what is called the reflex action, or other automatic movements quite as little associated with the immediate operation of "mind"'—carry on the rest of the process. And it is some consolation to think that the appearance of pain and distress which marks convulsive disorders of all descriptions, is, for the most part, illusory. The premonitory symptoms may be very distressing, but the condition of the patient, when the fit is on, is that of insensibility to pain.

The general conviction was, that by music and dancing the poison of the tarantula was distributed over the whole body, and expelled through the skin; but, unfortunately, it was also believed that if the slightest vestige of it remained behind the disorder would break out again. Thus there was no confidence excited in a certain cure. Men who had danced themselves well one summer watched the next summer for the. returning symptoms, and found in themselves what they looked for. Thus—

"The number of those affected by it increased beyond belief, for whoever had actually been, or even fancied that he had been once bitten by a poisonous spider or scorpion, made his appearance annually whenever the merry notes of the Tarantella resounded. Inquisitive females joined the throng and caught the disease—not indeed from the poison of the spider, but from the mental poison which they eagerly received through the eye; and thus the cure-of the Zarantati gradually became established as a regular festival of the populace.

It was customary for whole bands of musicians to traverse Italy during the summer months, and the cure of the disordered was undertaken on a grand scale. This season of dancing and music was called "The women's little carnival," for it was women more especially who conducted the arrangements. It was they, too, it seems, who paid the musicians their fee. The music itself received its due share of study and attention. There. were different kinds of the Tarantella (as the curative melody was called) suited to every variety of the ailment,

One very curious circumstance connected with this disease must not pass unnoticed—the passion excited by certain colours. Amongst the Germans, those afflicted by St. Vitus's dance were enraged by any garment of the colour of red. Amongst the Italians, on the contrary, red colours were generally liked. Some preferred one colour, some another, but the devotion to the chosen colour was one of the most extraordinary symptoms which the disease manifested in Italy. The colour that pleased the patient he was enamoured of; the colour that displeased excited his utmost fury.

"Some preferred yellow, others were enraptured with green; and eyewitnesses describe this rage for colours as so extraordinary that they can scarcely find words with which to express their astonishment. No sooner did the patients obtain a sight of their favourite colour than they rushed like infuriated animals towards the object, devoured it with their eager looks, kissed and caressed it in every possible way, and, gradually resigning themselves to softer sensations, adopted the languishing expression of enamoured lovers, and embraced the handkerchief, or whatever article it might be which was presented to them, with the most intense ardour, while the tears streamed from their eyes as if they were completely overwhelmed by the inebriating impression on their senses.

a ee thi fits of a certain Capuchin friar in Tarentum excited so much curiosity that Cardinal Cajetano proceeded to the monastery that he might see with his own eyes what was going on. As soon as the monk, who was in the midst of his dance, perceived the spiritual prince clothed in his red garments, he no longer listened to the tarantella of the musicians, but with strange gestures endeavoured to approach the cardinal, as if he wished to count the very threads of his scarlet robe, and to allay his intense longing by its odour. The interference of the spectators, and his own respect, prevented his touching it, and thus, the irritation of his senses not being appeased, he fell into a state of such anguish and disquietude that he presently sunk down in a swoon, from which he did not recover until the cardinal compassionately gave him his cape. This he immediately seized in the greatest ecstasy, and pressed, now to his breast, now to his forehead and cheeks, and then again commenced his dance as if in the frenzy of a love fit."

Another curious symptom, which was probably connected with this passion for colyur, was an ardent tonging for the sea. These over-susceptible people were attracted irresistibly to the boundless expanse of the blue ocean, and lost themselves in its contemplation. Some were carried so far by this vague passionate longing as to cast themselves into the waves.

The persuasion of the inevitable and fatal consequences of being bitten by the tarantula was so general that it exercised a dominion over the strongest minds. Men who in their sober moments considered the disorder as a species of nervous affection depending on the imagination, were themselves brought under the influence of this imagination, and suffered from the disorder at the approach of the dreaded tarantula. A very striking anecdote of this kind is told of the Bishop of Foligno. Quite sceptical as to the venom of the insect, he allowed himself to be bitten by a tarantula. But he had not measured the strength of his own imagination, however well he had estimated the real malignancy of the spider. The bishop fell ill, nor was there any cure for him but the music and the dance. Many reverend old gentlemen, it is said, to whom this remedy appeared highly derogatory, only exaggerated their symptoms by delaying to have recourse to what, after all, was found to be the true and sole specific.

But even popular errors are not eternal. This of Tarantism continued, our author tells~us, throughout the whole of the seventeenth century, but gradually declined till it became limited to single cases. "It may therefore be not unreasonably maintained," he concludes, "that the Tarantism of modern times bears nearly the same relation to the original malady as the St. Vitus's dance which still exists, and certainly has all along existed, bears, in certain eases, to the original dancing mania of the dancers of St. John."

In a subsequent chapter, our author informs us that a disease of a similar character existed in Abyssinia, or still exists, for the authority he quotes is that of an English surgeon who resided nine years in Abyssinia, from 1810 to the year 1819. We cannot pretend to say that we have ever seen the book, which the learned German has, however, not permitted to escape him—we have never seen the Life and Adventures of Nathaniel Pearce, written by himself; but, judging by the extract here given, Nathaniel Pearce must be a person worth knowing, he writes with so much candour and simplicity. The disease is called in Abyssinia the Tigretier, because it occurs most frequently in the Tigre country. The first remedy resorted to is the introduction of a learned Dofter, "who reads the Gospel of St. John, and drenches the patient with cold water daily." If this does not answer, then the relations hire a band of trumpeters, drummers, and fifers, and buy a quantity of liquor; all the

young men and women of the place assembled at the patient's house, and she (for it is generally a woman), arrayed in all the finery and trinkets that ean be borrowed from the neighbours, is excited by the music to dance, day after day if necessary, till she drops down from utter exhaustion. The disease is attended with a great emaciation; and the doctor says "he was almost alarmed to see one nearly a skeleton move with such strength." He then proceeds to recount his own domestic calamity in a strain of the most commendable candour:—

"I could not have ventured to write this from hearsay, nor could I conceive it possible until I was obliged to put this remedy in practice upon my own wife, who was seized with the same disorder. I at first thought that a whip would be of some service, and one day attempted a few strokes when unnoticed by any person, we being by ourselves, and I having a strong suspicion that this ailment sprang from the weak minds of women, who were encouraged in it for the sake of the grandeur, rich dress, and music which accompany the cure. But how much was I surprised, the moment I struck a light blow, thinking to do good, to find that she became like a corpse; and even the joints of her fingers became so stiff that I could not straighten them. Indeed, I really thought that she was dead, and immediately made it known to the people in the house that she had fainted, but did not tell them the cause; upon which they immediately brought music, which I had for many days denied them, and which soon revived her; and I then left the house to her relations, to cure her at my expense. One day I went privately with a companion to see my wife dance, and I kept at a short distance, as I was ashamed to go near the crowd. In looking steadfastly upon her, while dancing or jumping,more like a deer than a human being, I said that it certainly was not my wife; at which my companion burst into a fit of laughter, from which he could searcely refrain all the way home."

The capability of sustaining the most violent exercise, for a long time together, and on very little food, is not one of the 'east perplexities attendant upon these nervous or epileptic diseases. The partial suspension of sensation and volition, by sparing the brain, may have something to do with it. But into scientific perplexities of this kind we cannot now enter. One plain and homely caution is derivable from all these histories. Good sense is a great preservative of health. Do not voluntarily make a fool of yourself, or your folly may become in turn the master of your reason. Epilepsy has been brought on by the simulation of epilepsy. We doubt not that a man might dance to his own shadow, and talk to it, as it danced before him on the wall, till he drove himself into a complete frenzy. A sect in America thought fit to introduce certain grimaces, laughing, weeping, and the like, into their public service. It was not long before theirs grimaces, in some of their numbers, became involuntary; the muscles of the face had escaped the control of the will. A decided tongue-mania was exhibited a short time amongst the Irvingites. Happily, in the present state of society, men's minds are called off into so many directions, that a predominent idea of this kind has little chance of establishing itself in that tyrannous manner which we have seen possible in the middle ages. But it is better not to play with edged tools. If people will stand round a table, fixing their minds on one idea—that a certain mysterious influence will pass through their fingers to move the table—they will lose, for a time, the voluntary command over their own fingers, which will exert themselves without any volition or consciousness on their part. They are entering, in fact, into that state which, in the olden time, was considered a demoniacal possession; so that, speaking from this point of view, one may truly say that "Satan 'does turn the table," but it is by entering into the 'table-turner. When we have been asked, whether there is anything in mesmerism, we have always answered—a great deal more than you ought, without medical advice, to make trial of. Nor do we at all admire the performance of the so-called electro-biologists. | Experiments in the interest of science are permissible; but is it fit that any one should practise the art of inducing a temporary state of idiocy in persons of weak or susceptible nerves, for the purpose of collecting a crowd, and passing round the hat?

...

pp. 84

Sect. 2. — St. Vitus's Dance. `["Clionis Sancti Viti, or St. Vitas' Dance; the lascivious dance, Paracelsus calls it, because they that are taken with it, can do nothing but dance till they be dead, or cured. It is so called for that the parties so troubled were wont to go to St Vitus for help; and, after they had danced there awhile, they were certainly freed. 'Tis strange to hear how long they will dance, and in what manner, oyer stools, forms, tables; even great-bellied women sometimes (and yet never hurt their children) will dance so long that they can stir neither hand nor foot, but seem to be quite dead. One in red clothes they cannot abide. Musick above all things they love; and therefore magistrates in Germany will hire musicians to play to them, and some lusty, sturdy companions to dance with them. This disease hath been very common in Germany, as appears by those relations of Schenkius, and Paracelsus in his book of madness, who 'brags how many several persons he hath cured of it. Felix Platcrus (de Mentis Alienat. cap. 3.) reports of a woman in Basle whom he saw, that danced a whole month together. The Aiahians call it a kind of palsie. Bodine, in hia fifth book, de Repub. cap. 1. speaks of this infirmity; Monavius, in his last epistle to Scoltizius, and in another to Dudithus, where you may read more of it." — Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy, Vol. I. p. 15.— Traansl. note.]`

Strasburg was visited by the "Dancing Plague" in the year 1418, and the same infatuation existed among the people there, as in the towns of Belgium and the Lower Rhine. `[J. of Koinigehoven, the oldest German Chronicle in existence. The contents are general, but devoted more exclnsirely to Alsace and Strasburg, published by Schiltern, Strasburg, 1698. 4to. Observat. 21, of St. Vitus's Dance, p. 1085. f. "Viel hundert fingen zn Strasbourg an Zu tanzen und springen Frau and Mann, Am ofinen Markt, Gassen nnd Strassen Tag und Nacht ihrer viel Dicht assen. Bis ihn das Wiithen wieder gelag. St. Vita Tanz ward genannt die Plag." "Many hundreds of men and women began to dance and jump in the public marketplace, the lanes, and the streets of Strasburg. Many of them ate nothing for days and nights, until their mania again subsided. The plague was called St. Vitus's Dance.]` Many who were seized at the sight of those affected, excited attention at first by their confused and absurd behaviour, and then by their constantly following the swarms of dancers. These were seen day and night passing through the streets, accompanied by musicians playing on bagpipes, and by innumerable spectators attracted by curiosity, to which were added anxious parents and relations, who came to look after those among the misguided multitude who belonged to their respective families. Imposture and profligacy played their part in this city also, but the morbid delusion itself seems to have predominated. On this account religion could only bring provisional aid, and therefore the town-council benevolently took an interest in the afflicted. They divided them into separate parties, to each of which they appointed responsible superintendents to protect them from harm, and perhaps also to restrain their turbulence. They were thus conducted on foot and in carriages to the chapels of St. Vitus, near Zabem and Rotestein, where priests were in attendance to work upon their misguided minds by masses and other religious ceremonies. After divine worship was completed, they were led in solemn procession to the altar, whore they made some small offering of alms, and where it is probable that many were, through the influence of devotion and the sanctity of the place, cured of this lamentable aberration. It is worthy of observation, at all events, that the Dancing Mania did not recommence at the altars of the saint, and that from him alone assistance was implored, and through his miraculous interposition a cure was expected, which was beyond the reach of human skill. The personal history of St. Vitus is by no means unimportant in this matter. He was a Sicilian youth, who, together with Modestus and Cresoentia, suffered martyrdom at the time of the persecution of the Christians, under Diocletian, in the year 303. `[Caes. Baron. Annales ecclesiastic. Tool II. p. 819. Colon. Agripp. 1609. fol. See the more ample Acta Sanctorum Junii (The 15th of Jane is St. Titus's day), Tom. II. p. 1013. Antwerp. 1698. fol. From which we shall merely add that Masara, in Sicily, is supposed to haye been the birth-place of our Saint, and that his father's name was Hyku; that he went from thence with Crescentia (probably his nurse) and Ifodesttit to Lttcania, with both of whom he suffered martyrdom under Diocletian, They are all said to have been buried at Florence, and it was not long before the miraculous powers of St. Vitus, which had already manifested themselves in his lifetime, were acknowledged throughout Italy. The most celebrated of his chapels were situated on the Promontory of Sicily (called by his name), in Rome and in Polignano, whither many pilgrimages were made by the sick. Persons who had been bitten by mad dogs believed that they would find an infallible cure at his altars, though the power of the Saint in curing wounds of this kind was afterwards disputed by the followers of St. Hubertus, the Saint of the Chase. In 672, his body was with much pomp moTcd to Apulia, but soon after the priests of many churches and chapels in Italy, gave out that they were in possession of portions of the saint's body which worked miracles. In the eighth century the Teneration of this youthful martyr extended itself to France, and the honour of possessing his body was cmiferred on the church of St. Denys. By command of the Pope it was solemnly delivered on the 19th of March, 836, by the Abbot ffiUincmta, of St. Denys, to the Abbot TFartnta, of Correy (founded in 822). On its way thither, which occupied three months (to the 13th of June), many miracles were performed, and the subsequent Abbots of Correy were able for centuries to maintain the popular belief in the miraculous healing power of their relics, which had indiscriminate influence on all diseases, more especially on those of a demoniacal kmd. See Honachi anonymi Historia translationis S. Yiti. In G. H. Periz^ Monumenta GennanisB Historica. Tom. II. HannoT. 1828. foL p. 676. As a proof of the great veneration for St Vitus in the fourteenth century, we may further mention that Charles lY. dedicated to him the Cathedral of Prague, of which he had laid the foundation, and caused him to be proclaimed patron Saint of Bohemia, and a nominal body of the holy martyr was, for this purpose, brought from Parma. Act. Sanctor. loc. cit.]` The legends respecting him are obscure, and he would certainly have been passed over without notice among the innumerable apocryphal martyrs of the first centuries, had not the transfer of his body to St. Denys, and thence, in the year 836, to Corvey, raised him to a higher rank. From this time forth, it may be supposed that many miracles were manifested at his new sepulchre, which were of essential service in confirming the Roman faith among the Germans, and St. Vitus was soon ranked among the fourteen saintly helpers (Nothhelfer or Apotheker). `[Probably a corruption of Apotropaei. The expression is constantly met with; for example, in Agricola, Proverbs, No. 497. These are the Giol dXi^iKOjcoc, the dii averrunci of the ancients. The fourteen saints, to whose churches (between Bamberg and Coburg) thousands still annually make pilgrimages, are the following: 1. Georgius. 2. Blasius. 8. Erasmus. 4. Yitus. 6. Pantaloon. 6. Christophorus. 7. Dionysius. 8. Cyriacus. 9. Achatius. 10. Eustachius. 11. AEgidius. 12. Margaretha. 13. Oatharma. 14. Barbara.]` His altars were multiplied, and the people had recourse to them in all kinds of distresses, and revered him as a powerful intercessor. As the worship of these saints was however at that time stripped of all historical connexions, which were purposely obliterated by the priesthood, a legend was invented at the beginning of the fifteenth century, or perhaps even so early as the fourteenth, that St. Vitus had, just before he bent his neck to the sword, prayed to God that he might protect from the Dancing Mania all those who should solemnize the day of his commemoration, and fast upon its eve, and that thereupon a voice from heaven was heard, saying, "Vitus, thy prayer is accepted." `[J. Agricola. Sybenhundert und funffzig Tentscher Sprichwörter. No. 497. Seven hundred and fifty German Proverbs. Hageman, 1637. 8vo. fol. 248.]` Thus St. Vitus became the patron saint of those afflicted with the dancing plague, at St. Martin of Tours was at one time the succourer of persons in small-pox; St. Antonius of those suffering tinder the "hellish fire;" and as St. Margaret was the Juno Lucina of puerperal women.

Article III. — Choreomania: An Historical Sketch, with some Account of an Epidemic observed in Madagascar. By Andrew Davidson, F.R.C.P.E., etc., Physician to the Court of Madagascar.

Amongst the epidemics of the Middle Ages, one of the most peculiar, and to the psychologist one of the most interesting, is the dancing mania which, for at least two centuries and a half, appeared at irregular intervals in various parts of Europe. It received different names in different countries. Throughout Western Europe it was called chorea, chorea Sancti Viti, choreademonoraania, the devil's dance, or the dance of St John; while in Italy, in more modern times, it was known as tarantism. The same disease has been observed in Abyssinia about the beginning of the present century, where it was called tigretier.

It is not my design to give a full account of this malady in its various epidemics, but simply to sketch some of its leading historical features, for without some acquaintance with its history, the following narrative of what was observed in Madagascar, would be imperfectly understood. This disease, which we shall name Choreomania, was, as I have said, originally called chorea, or Saint Vitus's dance; but these terms are now inseparably, though inaptly, applied to another and perfectly distinct nervous affection. From this change in name, along with the disappearance of the original chorea from Europe, considerable confusion has arisen. Not a few authors have regarded the descriptions of choreomania by the older writers as applying to modern chorea, and as these are entirely inconsistent with our everyday experience of the latter disease, they have considered the accounts of the epidemics of choreomania during the Middle Ages as extravagant and untrustworthy. The short allusion which Mason Good has made to the original disease in his classic work `[Dr Good's Study of Medicine. 4th edition. Vol. iii. p. 33.]` indicates that he had fallen into this error. In a similar way, that prince of modern physicians, Joseph Frank, proceeding upon the assumption that choreomania is identical with chorea, says,— "Those who pretend that in 1374 chorea became epidemic, evidently confound it with the cereal malady (ergotism). In truth, however, chorea does not exhibit itself generally in an epidemic form, but, with some exceptions, is always sporadic." `[Practice of Medicine. By Joseph Frank, Art. Chorea.]` Now, it is perhaps possible that one of the forms of ergotism may be liable to be mistaken for the chorea of modern nosologists; it could not have been confounded with choreomania, with which it has nothing -in common. It is sufficient, however, to say that no one maintains that the disease referred to by Joseph Frank was epidemic in 1374. In one of the most recent, and undoubtedly one of our best text-books on medicine by Dr Aitken `[The Science and Practice of Medicine. By William Aitken, M.D. New ed. Vol. ii. pp. 337 and 338.]` the same confusion occurs. Thus, treating of chorea, he writes as follows:— "In Germany, it was said for two centuries to have been epidemic, and the patients, probably many of them maniacs, were wont to join in frantic dances; and as late as 1673, they went in procession to the church of some favourite saint, of whom St John, St Guy, and St Vitus were the most reputed." `[It is a popular mistake to suppose that the patients suffering from this disorder resorted to the shrine of St John, as they did to that of St Vitus, for relief; the origin of the title, dance of St John, requires a perfectly different explanation.]` Now, the chorea of modern nosologists was never said to have been epidemic; that which was epidemic was clearly a different disease altogether.

Sir Thomas Watson `[Lectures on the Principles and Practice of Physic. By Thomas Watson, M.D. 4th ed. Vol. i. p. 579.]` has appended to his lecture on chorea a short statement regarding the original disease, which proves that he recognises its true character. "The name," he justly remarks, "was applied, and much more suitably, to another set of symptoms of a most singular kind, concerning the real occurrence of which we might well be sceptical if we had not the authentic narratives of many instances of such disorder from different persons of credit, as well in this country as in others An affection characterized by movements which cannot be called spasmodic, but are rather owing to the irresistible propensity to muscular action, increased sometimes to a sort of mania by the force of imitation, or by the sound of music. It is the volition in this case that is morbid or perverse." `[Paracelsus conceived that in the dancing mania the volition was temporarily suspended, not prevented.]` To increase the confusion, some authors have classed with choreormania many anomalous forms of nervous manifestation, some of which are evidently the result of organic disease of the nervous centres. Such are the cases recorded by Sagar and others, of patients who could only go forwards or backwards, or these singular diseases described as rotatio and malleatio.

Choreomania is undoubtedly distinct from spasmodic chorea on the one hand, and from these singular forms of perverted motion on the other. The various epidemics have been admirably described by Hecker, to whose work `[The Epidemics of the Middle Ages. From the German of J. F. C. Hecker. 3d ed. Lond. Pp. 80 to 167.]` those desirous of information may refer, and in which the curious will find references to and quotations from the original authorities on this subject. Some very interesting information is also to be found in Heeser's History of Epidemic Diseases. `[Geschichte der Epidemischen Krankheiten. Von Dr H. Hseser. 8vo, Jena, 1865]`

Choreomania may be defined as a psycho-physical disease, in which the will, intellectual faculties, and moral feelings are all more or less perverted, with an irresistible impulse to motion, and an insane love of music, often sporadic, but with a tendency in certain circumstances to become epidemic.

The first appearance of the dancing mania on record, occurred at Kolbig, in the year 1021. Unfortunately, we cannot rely upon the accuracy of the accounts of it that have come down to us, as they are undoubtedly mixed up with the fabulous. The simple fact that such an event occurred can alone be accepted as historical; beyond this there is no certainty. The tradition is, that a dozen of country people having been seized with this disease during the time of divine service, the priest, Ruprecht, cursed them to dance and howl for twelve months for having interrupted the worship, and that this curse was only removed by the prayers and intercession of two bishops, that four of the twelve died, and the remaining eight continued to suffer from tremblings of the limbs during the rest of their lives. Then, again, in the year 1278, two hundred persons were seized with it at Utrecht, and while dancing on the Mosel Bridge, the structure gave way, and many of them perished.

But perhaps the first remarkable outbreak occurred in the year 1374, under the name of St John's dance, because it began on St John's day, which was observed in the earlier centuries in the most outrageous manner, with mirth, debauchery, and dancing. It seems to be this epidemic which is refeiTcd to by Frank, and, strangely enough, supposed by him to have been owing to ergotism. "At Aix la Chapelle", says Hecker, "assemblages of men and women were seen who had come out of Germany, and who were united by one common delusion. They formed circles hand in hand, and, appearing to have lost all control over their senses, continued to dance, regardless of the bystanders, for hours together in wild delirium, until at length they fell to the ground in a state of exhaustion. They then complained of extreme oppression, and groaned as if in the agonies of death until they were swathed in cloths bound tightly round their waists, upon which they again recovered." The swathing, which was rendered more effective by the aid of a turn-stick, was resorted to on account of tympany. While dancing they were said to have been insensible to external impressions, but haunted by religious visions and caprices of various kinds. The attacks often commenced with convulsions, difficulty of breathing, and mental depression. Beaked shoes very much excited the resentment of the dancers. In Liege, the manufacture of these fashionable articles was forbidden by law. Red colours seem to have been even more offensive, the influence of which, Hecker suggests, might lead us to imagine an extraordinary accordance between this spasmodic malady and the condition of infuriated animals: the fact, however, that in other epidemics the affected were enraptured with red colours, goes against this ingenious supposition. We shall have occasion again to notice this point, when treating of the disease as observed in Madagascar. "After the patients had recovered by means of exorcisms, they related that during the attack they felt as if standing in a stream of blood." `[Vide Hseser, op. cit.]` This epidemic spread rapidly throughout Germany, Belgium, and the neighbouring countries — hundreds of all ages and both sexes being led away by the sympathetic contagion, and this outbreak only finally ceased after a period of four years.

Exorcisms were resorted to by the priests when pater nosters and simpler means failed; but we are assured that kicks and blows heartily administered by the bystanders often afforded still greater relief, and were generally used as adjuvants to other means, and, strange enough, even gladly borne by the sufferers. The common people ascribed this calamity to the immorality of the priests, "Vulgus autem apud Leodium dicebat, quod hujusmodi plaga populo contigisset eo quod populus male baptizatus erat, maxime a JPresbyteribus suas tenentibus concubinas."

In the following century the dancing mania reappeared at Strasburg, as St Vitus's dance, and continued, more or less, for a century and a-half. The follies and vices of the previous epidemics were repeated. The patients resorted to the shrine of 8t Vitus in crowds, where they were cured — hence the name. The disease was common over northern Germany, France, and Belgium. It had a liking to the Rhine Valley; few of the cities in this district escaped this strange plague. The reason of this geographical predilection does not appear. In this new outbreak both sexes were affected, but women principally, and the upper classes and clergy were almost exempt. As may easily be supposed, profligacy and imposture became associated with these epidemics. Doubtless Paracelsus had too good reasons for naming it "the lascivious dance." The civil power in some places had to interfere for the suppression of these public exhibitions; but in others the magistrates employed relays of musicians and dancers for the relief of the affected. We need not be surprised that the loose and abandoned should feign a disease which gave them such an amount of license; but many were said to have acted in earnest the part they had assumed from design. Indeed, so real was the disease, and so great the frenzy of some of these poor, deluded mortals that they actually "dashed their brains out by running against walls and corners of buildings, or rushed headlong into rapid rivers where they found a watery grave."

While the morbid impulse lasted the physical endurance was truly extraordinary. This point has been insisted upon by every writer. Thus many hundreds continued dancing for days and nights in the public places of Strasburg without tasting food. From what I nave myself witnessed, I can well enough believe the account by Felix Plater, of a case which certainly to many would seem almost incredible. Without givi.ig his words, his story isj that he remembered a girl who had the dancing mania, and who exhausted several powerful men, commissioned by the authorities to dance with her. They relieved each other by turns, and this continued above four weeks, when she fell down exhausted, and was carried to an hospital where she recovered. She had remained in her clothes all the time, entirely regardless of her lacerated feet. She merely sat down occasionally to take some nourishment, during which the hopping movement continued.

The disease known as tarantism, and which was once common in Italy, was undoubtedly choreomania. The writings of Ferdinando, Baglivi, and others contain very full descriptions of it. While we may reasonably doubt the traditional etiology of the affection, we must accept the evidence of so many trustworthy and competent observers regarding the symptoms of which they were eyewitnesses.

The tarantula or aranea tarantula of Linnajus, which many regard as the phalangium of the Greek and Roman writers, is the name given to a spider, common not only in Apulia but in various parts of Europe and Asia. The effects of the bite of the tarantula lave never been very satisfactorily made out. The subject is an interesting and curious one, upon which much has been written. A strong argument against the notion that choreomania was so caused is this, that whereas the spider has very probably existed in Italy for ages, choreomania only appeared there in the fourteenth or fifteenth century. Besides, the phalangia were known and carefully described by many ancient naturalists and physicians, but none of these ascribe to their bite the power of producing this strange disorder. Paulus Aegineta, `[Paulus iEgineta, vol. ii., 8vo, p. 169. Syd. Soc. Ed., Lond.]` treating of the bites of these spiders, mentions as *local* symptoms, redness, coldness, and itchiness of the part, and, *constitutionally*, grousing, trembling, pain in the stomach, vomiting, erections of the penis, dysuria, and cold perspirations, — all probable enough results, and quite in accordance with what we know of the action of animal poisons.

The premonitory symptoms of tarantism were melancholy and lassitude, sometimes sleeplessness, with excitement, and occasionally tremors and vomiting. These symptoms often appeared in those bitten by the tarantula, when predisposed to the malady; not that the bite actually produced the disease, but in a nervous, excitable person, fully convinced that the poison produced such symptoms, and brooding over a bite real or imaginary, we can easily understand how the terror itself should induce this psychological condition. We must remember that the most ridiculous opinions prevailed even among scientific men on this- subject. Almost every species and variety of spider, not only in Italy, but eveiy where, was considered poisonous. Scaliger affirms that so vinilent were some of the spiders found in Gascony, that "if trodden upon, so as to be crushed, their poison would penetrate through the verysoles of the shoes." No wonder then if a nervous girl who believed herself even to have been in contact with this loathed insect, should become affected with what she understood to be the inevitable consequences of the poison. Again, when these symptoms made their appearance, the patient, influenced by the universal delusion, readily fancied that they must have been bitten.

From the premonitory melancholy, patients were aroused by the sound of music; and a great variety of instruments was in use. Baglivi `[Baglivi, Dissertatio I. — De Anatome, morsu, et effectibus Tarantulae. Lugduni in Batavis, 8vo, 1699, pp. 35, 38.]` enumerates among the instruments employed to cure tarantism, the drum, timbrel, shepherd's pipe, lyre, and cymbal, along with fiddles and flutes of various kinds. If we can credit that celebrated author, and in this particular we cannot doubt his statement, some patients were quite unaffected by certain of these musical instruments, yet immediately responded to another, and forthwith began to dance. In fact, there seems to have been a wonderful amount of caprice in this respect; but human credulity cannot believe that this dislike of certain instruments and partiality for others, was, as Baglivi asserts, dependent upon the size, colour, or virus of the spider which had inflicted the wound.

Whatever differences there may have been in regard to the instrument, all agreed in their love of quick and lively music, and even the least musical seem, while under this disease, to have become so wonderfully acute and just in their perception of harmony, that a false note was unendurable.

Bands of music traversed the country to cure the malady, and no doubt often caused, or at least encouraged it. The dancing generally continued from ten to fourteen hours daily, and from three to six successive days, and this amount of exertion we are told gave rise to no apparent fatigue. As in St Vitus's dance, so in tarantism • the mania showed a tendency to recur annually, p.nd was cured every year by resorting to the means we have described. Whether a foregone belief that the disease was not to be eradicated, but must necessarily return, by preying upon the mind produced this result, or whether, as is probable, some other cause operated in this way, it is impossible to say

The ordinary termination of the disease seems to have been in recovery, and, as we said, its duration was comparatively limited. The other phenomena of the disease were not so uniform. Some, in their infatuation, cast themselves into the sea or into rivers, courting destruction, others were buried up to the neck in earth to obtain relief. Many afflicted by melancholy frequented the tombs, while others, labouring under sexual excitement, abandoned themselves to their passions. Baglivi says that, "maids and women, otherwise chaste enough, without any regard to modesty, fall a sighing, howling, and into very indecent motions . . . they love to be tossed to and again in the air and the like. . . . Others you cannot please, unless they be soundly drubbed on the breech, heels, feet, and back." Unlike the St John's dancers in Germany, those affected by tarantism generally liked red colours; green seems also to have been much admired. It is unnecessary to enter into a minute description of the tigretiei", or dancing mania of Abyssinia. The account of it in Hecker's work, to which we have referred, or the original by Pearce, `[Pearce's Abyssinia. Lond., 1831.]` is within the reach of those interested in the subject. A short summary is all that is necessary, as this will suffice to show its identity with the disease in Europe.

(a.) It was more or less epidemic, chiefly affecting women.

(b.) It began with symptoms of constitutional disorder, at first febrile, which sometimes gave place to a lingering marasmus, with an affection of speech, and was occasionally fatal.

(c.) It was characterized by an intense craving for music, and an impulse to dance, leap, or i-un, with an almost supernatural power of physical endurance while the mania lasted.

(d.) It was regarded by the natives as a demoniacal possession,

All these points are brought out in the simple, and upon the whole trustworthy, narrative of Nathaniel Pearce, who was himself an eyewitness of what he relates, and who had the misfortune of observing it in his own wife. One thing is very remarkable in his account of the tigretier, and in this respect it differs a little from what has been observed elsewhere, viz., the very marked constitutional disorder preceding and accompanying the disease, proving — what the history of medical psychology affords many examples of — that the most serious physical disease may be determined or caused by psychological influences.

What affinity the leaping ague in Scotland had to true choreomania, I shall not attempt to decide. The following -account of it will illustrate its character:—

"Those affected complain of pain at the lower part of the back, to which succeed convulsion fits, or fits of dancing, at certain periods. During the paroxysms, they have all the appearance of madness, distorting their bodies in various ways, and leaping and springing in a surprising manner, whence the disease has acquired its vulgar name. Sometimes they ran with astonishing velocity, and olten over dangerous passes, to some place out of doors which they have fixed on in their minds, or perhaps even mentioned to those in company with them, — then drop down exhausted. At other times, especially when confined to the house, they climb in the most singular manner. In cottages, for example, they leap from the floor to what are called t!;e banks, or the beams by which the rafters are joined together, springing from One to another with the agility of a cat, or whirling round one of them with a motion resembling the fly of a jack." `[Sinclair's Statistical Account of Scotland, quoted by Hecker.]`

Having thus referred to choreomania, as has been seen in various parts of Europe and in Abyssinia, I shall proceed to give a short account of this singular disease as observed by myself and others in Madagascar, — a disease so strange that I might well have hesitated to record the facts, if they had not been witnessed by so many whose character and judgment place their evidence beyond question.

In the month of February 1863, the Europeans resident at Antananarivo, the capital ot Madagascar, began to hear rumours of a new disease, which it was said had appeared in the west or south-west. ...
