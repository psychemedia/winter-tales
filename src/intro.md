# Introduction

This collection of storynotes was originally motivated by the *'Tis Tales* set of "Winter Tales" performed at *Boojum and Snark* in Sandown, Isle of Wight, in December, 2022.

For my first solo set of Winter Tales, I started revisiting this tales to work some of them up a bit more, and try to make a better go of them...
