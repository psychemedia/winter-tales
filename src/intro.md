# Introduction

This collection of storynotes was originally motivated by the *'Tis Tales* set of "Winter Tales" performed at *Boojum and Snark* in Sandown, Isle of Wight, in December, 2022.

I realised I don't really have an seasonal tales in my repertoire, so this is somewhere I can start pulling some of them together.
